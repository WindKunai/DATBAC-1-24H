        "doc": "A Sydney cleric has claimed 40,000 Australian children go missing each year and are all victims of abuse. This is false. National missing persons data shows the number is much lower and 99 per cent of Australians who go missing are safely found. Bishop Mar Mari from Christ The Good Shepherd Church , a Christian Assyrian Orthodox Church in suburban Wakeley, makes the claim in a TikTok video posted to Facebook . \u201cThere was an investigation done here in Australia: 40,000 children disappear here in Australia every year,\u201d the bishop says. He goes on to suggest some of the country\u2019s most powerful people are involved in child abuse offences against the 40,000. He also suggests the 40,000 are still at risk, adding: \u201cIf I get the chance I will rescue those children myself.\u201d The figure the bishop uses is wrong. But the bishop\u2019s figure is an over-exaggeration and the vast majority of people reported missing \u2013 children and adults \u2013 are found alive and well within days. An Australian Federal Police (AFP) representative pointed AAP FactCheck to statistics from its National Missing Persons Coordination Centre , which works with all the nation\u2019s police agencies. It showed there were more than 55,000 total missing person reports to Australian police in 2022. More than half (54 per cent) of the reports in 2022 related to those aged 13-17. That\u2019s roughly 29,700. More than 99 per cent, or about 54,450, of all missing persons were safely found. There are about 2500 long-term missing people in Australia, which means missing for three months or longer. The AFP representative said it wasn\u2019t possible to isolate how many were children, because some had become adult age during the time they had been missing. The AFP runs the National Missing Persons Coordination Centre. Not all missing children are victims of abuse, as claimed in the video. The AFP\u2019s Missing Persons website explains the reasons people disappear are varied and can include anxiety and depression, misadventure, homelessness, dementia, domestic violence, becoming a victim of crime, and drug abuse. Research the AFP released in March 2021 shows young people living in out-of-home care are at the highest risk of going missing. Of all missing youth, 25.6 per cent of children aged under 12 and 18 per cent of those aged between 13 and 17 are Indigenous (page 62). Some 34 per cent of youth who go missing from care are Indigenous. A November 2021 report in The Conversation estimates 48 young people under 18 go missing every day in Australia \u2013 or about 17,520 annually. Indigenous young people comprise about 20 per cent of missing children, while making up less than six per cent of the Australian population under 18. The report argues missing Indigenous children do not get the same media attention as famous cases such as William Tyrrell in NSW and Cleo Smith in Western Australia receive. Missing NSW boy William Tyrrell has not been found. This 2016 report from the Australian Institute of Criminology states more than 305,000 people were reported missing between 2008 and 2015, an average of 38,159 each year. Youths aged 13-17 years were most likely to go missing; half of all people reported missing between 2008 and 2015 were in this age group and less than 10 per cent were younger children. More than 60 per cent of those who went missing returned or were found within 48 hours. Ninety-eight per cent were ultimately found, most alive. The Verdict The claim 40,000 Australian children \u201cdisappear\u201d each year and are subjected to abuse is false. In 2022 the figure was fewer than 30,000 and the majority returned safely soon after going missing. The claim all missing children are abuse victims is also false, as there are myriad reasons why people go missing. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

But a little digging uncovers the claim is false. The archaeologist told AAP FactCheck the post is entirely fake. The book which looks like a rock is actually a rock which looks like a book. The post (screenshot here ) was shared on October 10 by the Facebook page Institute of Alternative History and Archaeology , which has 62,000 followers. It shows several photos of an alleged fossilised book found at Cable Beach , a popular tourist attraction near Broome . The post is fake news, not hard news. Text on the post states: \u201cIn Australia, at a depth of 12 meters, an object similar to a petrified book was discovered. One of the researchers, Thomas Kaminski, commented on the find: \u2018In sediments over 330 million years old, we found something that looked like a book. Its pages have managed to mineralize and no one will ever be able to read the contents. As for the binding, it was made of a metal alloy.\u201d Petrification is a process of fossilisation in which \u201corganic matter is completely replaced by minerals and the fossil is turned to stone\u201d. A fossil that is 330 million years old places it in the Carboniferous Period , which began about 358.9 million years ago, and ended 298.9 million years ago. The Facebook post quotes archaeology professor Jane Balme , from the University of Western Australia , speaking \u201cvery emotionally\u201d about her impressions of the book. \u201cWhen they sent me the photo, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, but then I was invited to Cable Beach,\u201d Prof Balme purportedly says in the post. \u201cThere really was an object in place that looked incredibly like a book. Despite this, I had doubts about her age. It\u2019s very difficult to believe that someone could have created it more than 300 million years ago.\u201d Tourists in search of a good read at Cable Beach. However, Prof Balme \u2013 who has authored, co-authored or edited some 89 published pieces of archaeological research \u2013 told AAP FactCheck the post was \u201centirely fake news\u201d. \u201cThe first I heard of it was when someone in the UK emailed me to ask whether I knew that my name was being used to support this ridiculous claim,\u201d Prof Balme said. \u201cThe person who posted the story has found an image of a natural rock formation and decided that it looked like a book. \u201cThey then made up a story and \u2018quoted\u2019 me to support their story.\u201d Prof Balme said the post left her dumbfounded. \u201cI have no idea how they found my name or why they chose me. I regard their use of my name as a form of libel,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, none of my professional colleagues would believe that I would support such a claim unless they thought I had gone off the planet.\u201d Prof Balme said she now received many emails, mostly from people in the US, asking her about the pictures. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone sensible would believe that Carboniferous life forms (sea creatures) could write a book let alone bind one.\u201d The Verdict The claim a photo shared to social media shows a petrified book dating back 300 million years is false. Professor Jane Balme, the archaeologist quoted in the Facebook post, told AAP FactCheck the image is of a natural rock formation and the story has been fabricated without her knowledge or approval.

        "doc": "With voting under way in the voice referendum , people are still spreading misinformation about using crosses on ballot papers, despite voters being implored to simply write \u2018yes\u2019 or no\u2019. Former Queensland MP and \u2018no\u2019 advocate Steve Dickson is the latest to rail against crosses not being accepted, claiming the voting system is \u201cskewed\u201d and \u201cfixed\u2019. He alleges an Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) document from 2004 which states an \u2018X\u2019 may count as a valid vote in senate elections is proof voting rules for the voice referendum have been nefariously changed. This is false. The 2004 document specifically relates to the validity of votes on senate ballot papers, not for referendums. The AEC has previously told AAP FactCheck rules about using ticks and crosses on referendum ballots have not changed for more than 30 years . For referendums \u2013 where voters are asked to write either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 in a box \u2013 ballot papers marked only with an \u2018X\u2019 don\u2019t count because the voting intention is unclear. Steve Dickson is spreading misinformation about referendum voting. The claim follows a Federal Court ruling in September 2023, reinforcing that ballot papers marked only with a cross would not be valid for the voice referendum . This hasn\u2019t stopped Mr Dickson, a former Queensland Liberal National government minister , from making what he calls a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d discovery in an October 2 Facebook video . Mr Dickson was elected to Queensland\u2019s parliament in 2006 but defected to One Nation before losing his seat in 2017 . He resigned from One Nation in 2019 , and stood as an independent senate candidate in 2022 . In the video, he discusses a letter he said the AEC sent to former One Nation senator Len Harris in 2004. Mr Dickson suggests the letter indicates referendum voting rules have been changed since 2004. Steve Dickson told his followers he\u2019d made a groundbreaking discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s a while back, it\u2019s from 2004. But really clearly what is written on this document, it goes: \u2018As indicated in the scrutineer handbook, a senate ballot paper will be formal if a preference mark is made above the line at the top of the senate ballot paper. The preference mark is defined as either a one, a cross or a tick\u2019\u2026,\u201d Mr Dickson says (video mark 1min 50sec). \u201cI don\u2019t know when they changed the rules\u2026 But the point I make today is the hypocrisy from the Australian Electoral Commission. One day they\u2019re telling you that ticks and crosses are okay, and a \u20181\u2019 is okay, but now crosses aren\u2019t any good. So I think the system is skewed. I think it\u2019s fixed.\u201d The claim voting rules have been changed disregards the significant difference in voting methods for senate elections and referendums. In senate elections, voters are instructed to use numbers to rank parties or candidates in order of preference. For a senate ballot paper to be valid, a voter must number at least six boxes above the line to indicate the parties or groups of their choice, or number at least 12 boxes below the line to preference individual candidates. However, a tick or cross is accepted on a senate ballot paper instead of a \u20181\u2019, as long as the voter\u2019s intention remains clear, according to the AEC\u2019s 2023 \u2018 ballot paper formality guidelines \u2018 (page 14 and page 19). The law guiding the circumstances in which a tick or cross can count as a first preference vote on senate ballot papers is at Section 269(1A) and section 268(A)(2)(a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Voting rules for referendums differ to those for senate elections. In a referendum, voters are asked to indicate whether they agree with the proposition on offer by writing either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 in a box. The AEC\u2019s guidelines state writing a cross in the box makes a referendum vote informal, \u201csince a cross on its own may mean either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no'\u201d (page 30). However, writing \u2018No X\u2019 into the box is acceptable, as \u201cthe intention of the voter is clear that they disapprove\u201d, the AEC guidelines say (page 31). An AEC representative told AAP FactCheck it continued to follow legal advice dating from 1988 and 2003 about the validity of votes at the referendum. The legal advice says because a tick is normally used to indicate approval, referendum ballot papers marked with ticks only would be formal. However, because crosses can be used to denote disapproval, ballots marked with an \u2018X\u2019 would not provide a clear indication of the voter\u2019s intentions in a yes/no referendum and so would be deemed informal, the advice states. The treatment of a tick or cross on a federal referendum ballot paper has remained the same \u201cduring at least the six previous federal referendum questions dating back more than 30 years\u201d, the AEC says . Regardless, the AEC has urged voters to write only \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on the referendum ballot paper \u2013 as the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 requires. \u201cIt is that easy: given the simplicity, the AEC expects the vast, vast majority of Australian voters to follow those instructions and cast a formal vote,\u201d the commission said in media release in August. The Verdict The claim a 2004 letter provides evidence the Australian Electoral Commission has changed the rules about the use of a cross on ballot papers is false. The letter refers to senate elections, not referendums. An \u2018X\u2019 may be counted as a valid first preference vote on a senate ballot paper, as long as the voter\u2019s intention is clear. However, on a referendum ballot paper requiring a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer, an \u2018X\u2019 would deem the vote informal because the voting intention would not be clear. The AEC says rules on the use of ticks and crosses on referendum ballot papers have not changed for at least 30 years. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.

This is false. A closer look at the signatories reveals relatively few are scientists, with the majority working in fields without any specialised climate knowledge. The list of Australian signatories alone reveals forestry and mining executives, lawyers, IT workers, teachers and a federal MP who used to be a grazier and boilermaker. Many Facebook posts \u2013 see here , here , here , here and here \u2013 are sharing key points from the document, including that there is no climate emergency and 1609 scientists worldwide have backed the declaration. Facebook posts falsely claim all the document\u2019s signatories are scientists. The wording is taken from the World Climate Declaration , published online by an independent foundation called Climate Intelligence (Clintel). Clintel was founded in 2019 by emeritus geophysics professor Guus Berkhout , who began his career with Shell in 1964 , and science journalist Marcel Crok . Clintel\u2019s info page says Dr Berkhout initiated the declaration as a \u201cone-page summary of the view of many climate realists in the world\u201d. Notably, Clintel does not claim the signatories to the declaration \u2013 described as a \u201cliving document\u201d frequently updated as signatories are added \u2013 are all scientists. However, people interested in signing the declaration are directed to an online form which states \u201cthe signatory list is used as a worldwide network of experts on climate matters\u201d. That description is repeated uncritically by advocates of the declaration such as Australian property investor Kevin Young, whose \u201cProperty Insights\u201d blog lists 136 Australians in the signatories list he describes as \u201cexperts in the field\u201d. Number three on his list is a physician, number four is a retired teacher, and number eight is a ship designer. The claim the declaration signatories are scientists has been picked apart elsewhere, such as this post on X (formerly Twitter), which states: \u201cI picked a random Aussie signatory: \u2018Gordon Batt, Director GCB Investments Pty Ltd\u2019. Not only not a climate scientist, not an eminent scientist, not a scientist, but a rando about whom a Google search turns up almost nothing.\u201d I picked a random Aussie signatory: \u201cGordon Batt, Director GCB Investments Pty Ltd\u201d. Not only not a climate scientist, not an eminent scientist, not a scientist, but a rando about whom a Google search turns up almost nothing (maybe some kind of property developer?) https://t.co/qAA23Tk05g \u2014 Arthur Dent (@ArthurCDent) August 28, 2023 AAP FactCheck also took a closer look at the 166 Australians on the list, which publishes signatories\u2019 names and their professions. They included nine medical practitioners, 11 teachers, 21 engineers, two architects, four IT experts, nine from the forestry and mining industry and 37 geologists. Seven on the list describe themselves as having some form of specialism in climate science. There were also two lawyers, including Adelaide-based Campbell Rankine, who confirmed to AAP FactCheck he was an attorney, not a scientist. Federal MP Colin Boyce , the Liberal National Party member for Flynn in Queensland, was also on the list. Mr Boyce refused to confirm or deny whether he is a scientist when contacted by AAP FactCheck . His parliamentary page lists among his qualifications and occupations before entering parliament: boilermaker, grazier/farmer, small business owner, earthmoving contractor and high-pressure pipe welder. Federal MP Colin Boyce has signed the document. The variety of occupations among the Australian cohort is typical of the wider list, which includes Canadians Callum Beck, a sessional professor in religious studies, and Stuart McDonald, a retired insurance broker, French architect Patrick Mellett; and Thomas A. Gilliam, a retired US accounting professor. The claim the signatories list is made up of scientists is also debunked here . Clintel\u2019s claim there is no climate emergency is debunked here . AAP FactCheck has previously looked into the question of scientific consensus around anthropogenic warming . This 2013 paper , for example, looked at 11,944 peer-reviewed articles and found 97.1 per cent endorsed the consensus on human-induced global warming. A dataset of 1372 climate researchers and their publication and citation data was used in this 2010 study to show 97-98 per cent of climate researchers most actively publishing supported the tenets of anthropogenic climate change. A 2016 study looked at peer-reviewed global warming articles from 2013 and 2014 and found only four of 69,406 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. The Verdict The claim 1609 scientists have signed a declaration claiming there is no climate emergency is false. A closer look at the list, which includes signatories\u2019 names and professions, reveals relatively few are scientists \u2013 let alone climate scientists. Among the 166 Australians on the list include lawyers, teachers and IT experts. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has attacked Labor\u2019s immigration record, claiming 105,000 asylum seekers have entered Australia since Anthony Albanese\u2019s government was elected. This is false. The 105,000 figure relates to the number of asylum seekers in Australia at the end of August 2023. Most were already in the country at the time of the May 2022 federal election . The majority of asylum seekers currently residing in Australia arrived during the 2013-2022 coalition government. Mr Dutton made the claim multiple times during an interview in Western Australia on October 4. \u201cLabor\u2019s presided over 105,000 asylum seekers over the course of the last 15 months \u2013 a record number in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 105,000 asylum seekers that have come in on (Albanese\u2019s) watch.\u201d Data disproves Peter Dutton\u2019s numbers on asylum seekers. The opposition leader was answering questions on immigration following the release of the Nixon review , a Labor-commissioned inquiry into the alleged exploitation of Australia\u2019s visa system. His comments about 105,000 asylum seekers coming to Australia under Labor were reported in the Sydney Morning Herald , Guardian Australia and the Australian Financial Review , though all three media outlets pointed out the inaccuracy of Mr Dutton\u2019s claim. AAP FactCheck asked Mr Dutton\u2019s office for the basis of his claim but did not receive a response. The Department of Home Affairs publishes detailed statistics on visa applications, immigration and asylum seeker claims. The figure at the centre of the claim relates to applications for subclass 866 visas , otherwise known as permanent onshore protection visas . The department describes the subclass 866 visa as being \u201cfor people who arrived in Australia on a valid visa and want to seek asylum\u201d. The visa is only available to people already in Australia who cleared immigration when they first arrived. Asylum seekers offered a subclass 866 visa can stay in Australia permanently as long as they meet other requirements, the department says. Asylum seekers can spend years awaiting a final determination on their visa status. The Refugee Council of Australia says it takes an average of more than two years for an onshore protection visa application to reach an initial decision by the department. Rejected applications can take 10 years or more to go through the full appeal and judicial review process, the council says. Asylum can also be claimed by people who arrive by sea, which the department refers to as \u2018 unauthorised maritime arrivals \u2018 (UMAs). However, for the purposes of this fact-check, all figures refer only to subclass 866 onshore protection visas, which was the subject of Mr Dutton\u2019s claim. The department publishes monthly statistics about subclass 866 visas as part of its humanitarian program dataset . That data shows 29,246 people in Australia were waiting for a decision on their subclass 866 visa application in August 2023, the most recent figures available at the time of writing (page 4). An additional 75,430 people had been refused a visa but remained in Australia and were \u201cyet to be deported\u201d, the figures show (page 4). Adding the two categories together makes a total of 104,676 asylum seekers either awaiting an outcome for their visa request or who already had their application refused. By comparison, the data for May 2022 , the month Labor was elected to government , shows 94,260 asylum seekers in Australia were either waiting for a visa decision or already had an application refused. Therefore, the number of asylum seekers has increased by about 10,400 people under Labor, when compared to May 2022. By those measures, it is clear Mr Dutton's claim is wrong as most asylum seekers were already in the country by the time Labor came to power. However, Associate Professor Daniel Ghezelbash from UNSW Sydney's Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law told AAP FactCheck it was not possible to say exactly when those asylum seekers entered the country. \"None of these people actually arrived as asylum seekers. All of them came through other visa pathways,\" Dr Ghezelbash said. Dr Ghezelbash said because the visa was only open to people who had already passed through immigration, it was unusual for a protection claim to be lodged at an airport. \"It is far more likely they've spent time living in the community on another valid visa for some period of time. It can be anywhere from a few months to many years.\" It was likely the vast majority of the 94,260 asylum seekers already in the country at the time of the May 2022 election entered Australia during the previous nine years of coalition government, Dr Ghezelbash said. The data shows 23,882 new subclass 866 visa applications were lodged in the first 15 full months of the Labor government (June 2022 to August 2023 inclusive). Therefore, 23,882 is the maximum possible number of current asylum seekers who entered Australia during that period. However, it is impossible to say how many people who entered the country in the past 15 months will claim asylum at some point in the future. AAP FactCheck 's analysis of the data found an approval rate of around 13 per cent for subclass 866 visas. This takes into account the total number of visa applications between September 2021 to August 2023 and the total number of approvals. However, it is not possible to determine whether the approvals relate to the visa applications for the same period. New applications have averaged about 1300 each month over the same time period, though the quantity of monthly lodgements has increased significantly since the 2022 federal election. Labor has responded to the Nixon review by pledging almost $160 million of additional resources to help speed up visa processing. The Verdict Peter Dutton's claim Labor has overseen 105,000 asylum seekers entering Australia is false. The figure refers to the 104,676 asylum seekers in the country as of August 2023. It does not refer to newly arrived asylum seekers, as suggested by Mr Dutton. Most of those 104,676 people were already in the country by the time Labor came to power in May 2022. However, because onshore protection visas are only available to people who enter the country with a valid visa, it is impossible to say exactly how many asylum seekers came to Australia during any given period.

        "doc": "A raft of social media posts have responded to comments by New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on the ease of voting, claiming anyone who looks over 18 and is currently in the country can vote in the upcoming election. This is misleading. While it is possible to vote in NZ without identification, the Electoral Commission (EC) has a system of scrutinising and rejecting fraudulent or invalid votes. The claims follow comments by Mr Hipkins in a Newshub interview shown in this Facebook post . The prime minister was responding to concerns that 10 days out from the election, one million voters still had not received their EasyVote card . The EasyVote pack , which speeds up the voting process, is sent to NZ voters who were enrolled at their current address by September 10, for the October 14 general election . \u201cYou do not need an EasyVote card to vote,\u201d the prime minister says in the interview. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t need to be enrolled and you do not need to take identification with you when you go to vote. \u201cIf you are a New Zealander over the age of 18, you need to show up to a polling booth and the staff will arrange for you to be able to vote.\u201d Social media users are suggesting anyone who looks over 18 can vote in NZ. In response to the video, the post says: \u201cDoes this sound like an election that is safe from fraud?\u201d Other posts are more direct. This post states: \u201cThe government setting up NZ elections so anyone can vote!!! The words from our \u2018Esteemed\u2019 Prime Minister \u2018You don\u2019t need ID to vote!!!\u2019 So anyone in this country who looks to be 18 or any adult can vote!! You don\u2019t need to be on the electoral roll!!\u201d In a separate post, the same Facebook user says: \u201cSo all the migrants labour bought in during the lockdowns etc that arent (sic) NZ citizens can vote!!!\u201d It\u2019s true that voters don\u2019t need ID and don\u2019t need to be on the electoral roll when they arrive at a polling booth to vote. The EC is clear about the process on its website . \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take your driver licence, your passport, or anything else with you to a voting place. No ID is required,\u201d it states. \u201cYour EasyVote card, if you have one, will make voting faster \u2014 but you can vote without it. \u201cWhen you go to vote, you\u2019re either marked off the printed roll at the voting place, or your details are recorded. During the official count, we compare all the rolls from all the voting places in each electorate to make sure everyone has only voted once.\u201d If a person\u2019s name is not on the printed roll at the voting place they can cast what is called a special vote . They may not be on the roll for various reasons, including that they\u2019re voting outside your electorate. The only difference in registering a special vote is that the individual is required to fill in an additional form. \u201cWe check every special vote to make sure each person is enrolled and eligible to vote,\u201d the EC says. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on the campaign trail in Waikanae. \u201cIf a special voter\u2019s name isn\u2019t on the electoral roll, the registrar of electors carries out more extensive checks. The registrar then says whether the voter is enrolled.\u201d Professor Andrew Geddis , an expert in election law at Otago University , explained the \u201cextensive checks\u201d that prevent situations like those suggested in the Facebook posts. He said that a special vote requires a declaration to be filled in giving the voter\u2019s name, address and confirming their eligibility to cast a vote. This will include that they have at some point lived in NZ for 12 months continuously and that they are an NZ citizen or resident permitted to remain here permanently. The individual will also need to specify the reason they\u2019re casting a special vote. \u201cIf the voter is not yet enrolled, that declaration serves to enrol the voter to vote (and so allows them to do so),\u201d Prof Geddis told AAP FactCheck by email. \u201cHowever, these special votes are not included in the election night count. Rather, the special vote declarations are checked by electoral officials to make sure they are accurate (that the person is entitled to enrol and vote). \u201cAs a part of this, the electoral officials get information from Immigration NZ under the Electoral Act 1993, s 263A , to ensure that someone on a resident visa does have the right to remain permanently. If someone was here as a tourist or similar, this would be flagged at that stage. \u201cIf the electoral officials determine that the special vote declaration is false in some respect, then the special vote is discounted \u2014 it never appears in the voting tally at any point.\u201d The EC confirmed the process of scrutinising special votes described above in an email to AAP FactCheck . The Verdict The claim that anyone who looks over 18 and is currently in New Zealand can vote in the election is misleading. It is true that people don\u2019t need to be on the electoral roll or have ID to cast a vote on October 14. However, an expert and the Electoral Commission told AAP FactCheck there are extensive checks to prevent illegal and invalid votes from being counted towards the final result.

        "doc": "A Facebook account posing as the official Wellington Airport page claims it is selling off lost luggage for just $NZ3 ($A2.80). The posts are fake and part of a scam. Photographs used in the scam are copied from online news stories and social media posts and have been edited. They were originally shot at airports in Berlin, London, and the US city of St Louis. Wellington International Airport and Air New Zealand both confirmed to AAP FactCheck the posts are fake. The posts have been made by an account named Wellington Airport Terminal. A screenshot of one of the scam Facebook posts. According to the page\u2019s transparency information , it previously operated under a different name, but changed to Wellington Airport Terminal on December 5, 2023. While New Zealand users can see the page, its visibility appears to be restricted based on location. Each of the posts show an image of a yellow sign reading \u201cAir New Zealand Lost Luggage 3.00 NZD\u201d among dozens of suitcases, with a caption instructing users to follow a link to purchase the unclaimed baggage. None of the edited images were taken at Wellington Airport. One post (screenshot here ) uses an image from a Reddit post about lost luggage in the German capital Berlin. A baggage tag visible in the bottom, right corner displays the codes \u201c BER \u201d and \u201c FRA \u201c, indicating the suitcase was going from Brandenburg Airport in Berlin to Frankfurt . The original image from the Wales Online website. Another post (screenshot here ) uses an image from a 2022 WalesOnline story about a woman whose luggage was put on the wrong flight to Heathrow Airport in London. Another post (screenshot here ) uses an image from a Washington Post story about lost luggage at St Louis Lambert International Airport . In each post, an Air New Zealand \u201clost luggage\u201d sign is edited into the photo. An Air New Zealand representative told AAP FactCheck the posts were \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d. Wellington International Airport external relations manager Phil Rennie also confirmed the posts were fake. \u201cThis page is 100 per cent a scam,\u201d Mr Rennie told AAP FactCheck . \u201cThere is no luggage for sale.\u201d The fake page lacks an official blue verification tick after its name. Mr Rennie said there was only one official Wellington International Airport page and Facebook users should always look for the blue verification tick after the page\u2019s username. The airport has addressed the scam posts on Facebook, providing tips to avoid being scammed. The posts contain a \u201cshop now\u201d button, which takes users to suspicious websites impersonating Wellington Airport or Air New Zealand. \u201cWe are urgently clearing out the airport warehouse and selling luggage that has been unattended for more than 6 months,\u201d the websites state. \u201cAccording to the rules, it should be disposed of, but we are organising a charity event and giving it away for just $3.\u201d Scammers are using Air New Zealand\u2019s name and logo in their posts. The websites prompt users to complete a survey , which indicates the scam\u2019s purpose may be to collect personal information. Netsafe chief executive Brent Carey has previously told AAP FactCheck some scam posts attempt to \u201ctrick a person into parting with personal or business details that a scammer can use to get access to a person\u2019s identity or their business networks or systems in an attempt to get hold of ways to take money from a person\u201d. Similar lost luggage scam posts unrelated to Wellington Airport have appeared here , here , and here . Scammers are making thousands of Facebook posts that encourage people to share them and/or click nefarious links. That means you may be tricked into a scam or advertising a scam to your family and friends on Facebook without realising it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital to know how to spot a potential scam post. HOW TO SPOT A SCAM POST ON FACEBOOK \u2013 THE RED FLAGS Treat posts appealing for help to find lost or found people or pets, offering extremely cheap or free products and services with caution if they include more than one of the following features: * The person encourages everyone to share their post widely. * They don\u2019t provide their contact details or they ask people to send them a DM or PM (direct message or private message). * The post includes only very vague details about the location of the person or pet, or the giveaway. * The account of the person posting is less than a year old, has no profile picture, has few friends, or isn\u2019t located in the same area as the subject of their post. This indicates their account is fake. * If you can\u2019t comment on the post because the person has disabled comments. This is done to stop people from warning others it\u2019s a scam. The Verdict The claim Wellington Airport is selling customers\u2019 lost luggage for $NZ3 is false. The Facebook posts use edited photographs of piles of luggage from around the world. Air New Zealand and Wellington International Airport told AAP FactCheck the posts are fake. The posts are a scam designed to obtain personal information or money from users.

        "doc": "Social media posts claim Japan\u2019s infant mortality rate plunged after 1994, when the nation ended all vaccinations for children aged under two. This is false. An immunisation expert told AAP FactCheck infant mortality in Japan has always been low and data shows it continues to fall as vaccination coverage increases. The nation has some of the highest child immunisation rates in the world and law changes in 1994 simply made vaccination voluntary, rather than mandatory. The claim is made in multiple Facebook posts, such as here , here , here and here . \u201cIn 1994 Japan ceased all vaccinations in any child under 24 months, and their infant mortality rate DROPPED by a whopping 96%!\u201d the posts read. A note added to the post states: \u201cThis should say Japan ceased mandatory vaccines and banned the MMR \u2026 it is true that their infant mortality improved vastly as a result.\u201d The note is closer to the truth, but still misleading. The Facebook posts are peddling misinformation. AAP FactCheck has debunked a similar claim and shown that while vaccinations have not been mandatory in Japan since 1994, the nation\u2019s Vaccination Law Act states people \u201cmust endeavour\u201d to receive routine vaccination against Class A disease, listing more than 10 including measles , tetanus and polio . A Japanese academic paper explains the immunisation law was revised in 1994. The law was launched in 1948 with the goal of decreasing endemic diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, polio, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and tuberculosis. The revision changed immunisation from a civic \u201cduty\u201d to an \u201ceffort duty\u201d, ending mass immunisation at schools and relying on people getting their children vaccinated individually. One event which ultimately led to the revision was two fatalities after DTwP (diphtheria, tetanus-toxoid, and whole cell pertussis ) vaccination in the mid-1970s. The vaccine was withheld for six years which led to a resurgence of 13,000 pertussis cases and dozens of deaths reported in 1979. Sharon Hanley , an immunisation program expert at the University of Aberdeen , told AAP FactCheck infant deaths increased whenever vaccination coverage decreased. \u201cInfant mortality (in Japan) definitely didn\u2019t decrease because vaccination coverage decreased,\u201d Dr Hanley said. \u201cInfant mortality has always been low in Japan.\u201d Japan has high infant vaccination rates and high-quality child healthcare. This is borne out in official OECD data , which shows Japan\u2019s infant mortality rate (the number of deaths of children aged under one year per 1000 live births) has been dropping year on year, from 4.6 in 1990 to 1.7 in 2021. This coincides with an increase in child vaccination coverage. A routine vaccine schedule released by Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases states vaccination begins when children are two months old. The biggest single drop in Japan\u2019s infant mortality, from 4.3 in 1995 to 3.8 in 1996, coincided with an increase in measles vaccination coverage and a big increase in diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis coverage , from 74 per cent to 99 per cent. The data shows that in 2021, 95.4 per cent of Japanese children around the age of one were vaccinated for measles , and 98.8 per cent around age one were vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis . Japan\u2019s immunisation program has continued to expand. A 2014 academic paper on progress in the Japanese program shows the nation\u2019s vaccination law underwent another major revision in April 2013 to include three new vaccines \u2013 the Hib , PCV7 and HPV vaccines. A 1993 paper analysed the reasons for Japan\u2019s low infant mortality rate , published before the law\u2019s revision in 1994. It suggested a range of reasons why Japan had the world\u2019s lowest infant mortality rate, including comprehensive use of a child health handbook, universal access to prenatal care and community support. The Verdict The claim infant mortality in Japan dropped 96 per cent after vaccines for children aged under 24 months ceased in 1994 is false. Infant vaccinations didn\u2019t cease, they were made voluntary, but vaccination coverage has steadily increased since 1994, while the mortality rate has steadily dropped. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate. AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network .

        "doc": "It is being claimed a US molecular biologist has revealed the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine contains 200 billion pieces of dangerous DNA. This is misleading. The biologists in question said the risk from any residual DNA in the vaccine is only theoretical. Experts and various health bodies have said there is no evidence to link DNA in the vaccines to adverse events. Various claims relating to \u201cdangerous\u201d DNA in the vaccine have been made in recent months, including in this post (archived here ). \u201cThe Pfizer shot contains 200 billion (dangerous) pieces of foreign DNA,\u201d the post reads. It links to a video of a senate hearing in the US state of South Carolina from September 2023, which the post says features molecular biologist Professor Phillip Buckhaults \u201cexposing this monumental crime\u201d. The post links to the professor\u2019s senate hearing. Prof Buckhaults claims the Pfizer vaccine is \u201ccontaminated with plasma DNA\u201d ( 3mins 32secs ). While presenting a slide ( 13mins 45secs ), he says each shot has about 200 billion pieces of plasmid DNA encapsulated in the lipid nanoparticle. Lipid nanoparticles are an emerging vehicle for gene delivery , which is the way the vaccines are transferred to cells. Prof Buckhaults also speculates that DNA in the jab could be the cause of rare but serious side effects ( 4mins 44secs ). He also claims there is a \u201ctheoretical risk of future cancer\u201d. However, the molecular biologist makes clear his claims are theoretical and haven\u2019t been tested ( 18 mins ). Prof Buckhaults repeated that point in a post on X , previously Twitter, on September 24, 2023. \u201cThe DNA is real, however the risk of this DNA is theoretical. There is no need to panic about past vaccination,\u201d he wrote in the post. Prof Buckhaults said his senate hearing comments were targeted at regulators and industry experts, not the general public, and had resulted in \u201ctotally inappropriate anxiety\u201d. \u201cIMO (in my opinion), these vaccines saved a lot of lives. Far more than the number of people who have had medical events subsequent to vaccine,\u201d he added. Pfizer has said there is zero evidence to support the claim. \u201cSo overall, these vaccines were a win. However, those who experienced harm deserve to have scientists and regulators look carefully at possible causes.  Even if the adverse events turn out to have nothing to do with the vaccine\u2026\u201d In another tweet in October, he said: \u201cI study a scientific mechanism that might explain *rare* events. There are currently no documented cases of the Pfizer vaccine causing cancer. I study the possibility just to make sure that it can\u2019t ever happen\u2026do not use my research topic or my video to create fear or panic or anxiety in others just to get attention on social media.\u201d Prof Buckhaults did not respond to a set of questions sent by AAP FactCheck . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says residual fragments of plasmid DNA used in templates for the mRNA vaccine are supposed to be broken down and removed during the manufacturing process. \u201cThe DNA template is not intended to be part of the final mRNA vaccines; however, very small amounts of residual bacterial DNA fragments may still be present,\u201d an EMA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email. However, the European regulator said it had not seen any reliable evidence of an association between mRNA vaccines and adverse events that could be linked to the presence of DNA material. \u201cNor are we aware of any scientific evidence showing that the very small amounts of residual DNA that may be present in vaccine batches could integrate into the DNA of vaccinated individuals,\u201d the EMA spokesperson added. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also said there is no evidence of any risk. \u201cWith over a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines administered, no safety concerns related to the sequence of, or amount of, residual DNA have been identified,\u201d the federal vaccine regulator told AAP FactCheck in an email. \u201cWhile concerns have been raised previously as theoretical issues, available scientific evidence supports the conclusion that the vaccines are safe and effective.\u201d Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said residual DNA is a \u201cmanufacturing impurity\u201d found in very low levels in many medicines and vaccines. Many millions of Australians have received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The regulator said while there is a theoretical possibility the residual DNA may be encased in lipid nanoparticles, it is not aware of any scientific evidence that this occurs in practice. \u201cThere is also no scientific evidence that residual DNA alters the human genome. The safe use of biological medicines in millions of patients for over 40 years shows that this technology is safe and residual DNA presents a low safety risk,\u201d a TGA representative told AAP FactCheck in an email. The TGA said the World Health Organization , European Pharmacopeia and regulators including the FDA have provided guidance on the acceptable limits of total residual DNA, and all mRNA vaccines registered in Australia comply with these limits. Pfizer also told AAP FactCheck in a statement that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d to support the claim. Similar claims have been debunked by other fact-checking organisations here , here , here , here and here . The Verdict The claim that a biologist has revealed the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine contains 200 billion pieces of dangerous DNA is misleading The professor in question said any risk is theoretical and has not been tested.

        "doc": "Facebook users are claiming manufacturing an electric vehicle battery produces the same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) as running a petrol car for eight years. This is false. Experts told AAP FactCheck the levels of CO2 emitted in EV battery production are significantly lower than the posts claim. The claim can be seen in this Facebook post (screenshot here ) which states: \u201cCool stat. Manufacturing JUST the battery for an electric car produces the same amount of CO2 as a gas engine does in 8 YEARS!!\u201d Similar claims are made here , here , here , here and here dating back as far as 2021. The posts offer no evidence for their claim. Experts told AAP FactCheck the claims are far from the truth. Emissions from manufacturing an EV battery can be calculated by multiplying the estimated kilograms (kg) of CO2 emitted per kilowatt hour (kWh) of the battery, with the total kWh capacity of the battery. There are varying estimates as to how many kg of CO2e per kWh of battery are emitted during production. The estimates depend on the date of the research, thus taking into account changes in energy mix and advances in manufacturing processes. The estimates also depend on the country of production. This 2022 research paper puts the figure at between 41kg and 89kg of CO2e, noting that the range could reduce to 10kg to 45kg by 2050 \u201cmainly due to the effect of a low-carbon electricity transition\u201d. This 2019 study ( page 5 ) from the Swedish Environmental Research Institute puts the range between 61kg and 106kg of CO2e/kWh of battery. Although several years old, this 2017 study looks at China, which dominates the battery production market . It found a range of 96kg to 123 kg. This paper , also from 2017, estimated battery production in Australia to be around 106kg CO2e/kWh. Hussein Dia , a professor of future urban mobility at Swinburne University, warned against people using the extremes of the various ranges to come up with misleading conclusions. But even when using a high estimate of 150kg of CO2e/kWh, the claim is wildly off. Using an estimated average battery size of 60kWh , Professor Dia said the 150kg CO2e/kWh would put the total emissions at around 9000kg or nine metric tons. In comparison, there have been various estimates of annual emissions from petrol cars. Professor Weixiang Shen , also from Swinburne University, said the US Environmental Protection Agency has found \u201ca typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year\u201d. Across eight years this would equal 36.8 metric tons. The average for cars in Australia is very similar. The grams of CO2 emitted per kilometre is around 370 . Multiplied by the average number of kilometres travelled each year (12,100 km) equals 4.47 metric tons. Across eight years this comes to 35.76 metric tons. This means EV battery production is the equivalent of about two years of driving a petrol car, not eight years as was claimed. EV battery production is continuing to improve when it comes to emissions, experts say. Associate Professor Nesimi Ertugrul , from the University of Adelaide, also highlighted the reusability of EV batteries as a mitigating factor in their emissions output. \u201cThey can be repurposed for five to 10 years in stationary applications (including community level storage), helping to reduce intermittency in renewable energy storage or grid support,\u201d Dr Ertugrul said. The claim has previously been debunked here and here . The Verdict The claim that manufacturing an electric vehicle battery emits the same level of carbon dioxide as driving a petrol engine car for eight years is false. The emissions output created by manufacturing one EV battery equates to roughly two years of running a petrol car. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "A vaccine sceptic\u2019s claim about children dying from COVID-19 jabs has been disproven by the very same dataset he uses to make his accusation. It is being claimed Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) figures show five children under the age of four were killed by vaccines in Australia. This is false. The TGA, Australia\u2019s health regulator, says it has not received a single report of children under five dying after COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of whether or not the death was directly caused by the jab. The claim was made in a December 11 Facebook post in which the author questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccination against the virus. The false claim has found an audience on Facebook. \u201c(Former health minister) Greg Hunt told you it was safe and effective,\u201d the post says. \u201cWhy have five kids under the age of four been reported as deaths from the COVID-19 vaccine in the TGA DAENS?\u201d DAENS (sic) refers to the TGA\u2019s Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN). The TGA uses DAEN as a surveillance system to monitor any health problems \u2013 also called \u2018adverse events\u2019 \u2013 associated with the use of approved medicines and medical goods in Australia. Reports of possible health issues associated with a medicine or medical product can be made by anyone including members of the public, health professionals and pharmaceutical companies. Adverse event reports are recorded in DAEN and used by the TGA to detect any unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events. However, when an adverse event is recorded in DAEN it does not necessarily mean the medicine or medical product was the cause . The issue may be related to an underlying illness or other factors or may have occurred coincidentally. In Australia, the vaccines are generally only recommended for those aged five and over. Vaccine sceptics often misuse DAEN data to claim high numbers of people are injured or killed by jabs, based on a false assumption that all post-vaccination injuries and deaths are directly caused by the shots. AAP FactCheck has previously debunked such claims here , here and here . The claim about five young children dying from COVID-19 vaccines is even easier to disprove. Data from DAEN can be analysed by filtering the data online . When selecting all COVID-19 vaccines and the age group \u201cless than 5\u201d (the youngest age group available in DAEN), the database returns 101 reports of adverse events, at the time of writing. None of those 101 adverse events resulted in death. In Australia, COVID-19 vaccination is generally recommended for people over five years of age and only recommended for children younger if they have specific needs or health risks, such as being immunocompromised. The most common adverse events recorded for children under five who received a jab were \u201cvaccination error\u201d, \u201cproduct administered to patient of inappropriate age\u201d and pyrexia (fever), according to DAEN. The TGA confirmed to AAP FactCheck that no children under five had died following COVID-19 vaccination. To date, the TGA has determined just 14 deaths are likely linked to the vaccines. At the time of writing, the TGA said it had received and reviewed 1005 reports of deaths in people who have been vaccinated against the virus. However, a TGA spokeswoman noted that only 14 of those were deemed likely to be related to vaccination and all 14 occurred in people aged at least 21 years old . \u201cImportantly, to answer the specific question, the TGA has not received any reported deaths for children under five,\u201d she told AAP FactCheck in an email. The Verdict The claim that health department data reveals five children under the age of four have died from COVID-19 vaccines in Australia is false. Data about health issues reported to have occurred after vaccination can be viewed in the TGA\u2019s adverse events database, which is publicly available online. The data reveals no children under five years of age have died following a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "A mysterious post is spreading on social media following the deadly riots and looting in Papua New Guinea (PNG). At the time of writing more than 23 people are dead and dozens injured following unrest in the capital Port Moresby and second-largest city Lae. The violence broke out on Wednesday after some public servants, including the police, discovered their fortnightly pay packets were short by up to K300 (AU$120). Police officers stood down at 10am local time and joined other workers in a demonstration at Parliament House in the capital. Some took advantage of the lack of police on duty by taking to the streets and looting. Shops and businesses were also set on fire. Rumours started spreading on social media ( here , here and here ) that the underpayment was due to the government hiking income tax rates from January 1. Protesters gathered at Port Moresby\u2019s Parliament House (file pic) on Wednesday. Some posts ( here , here and here ) pointed to legislation as proof. Prime Minister James Marape insisted that there had been no tax increase and instead the deductions were the result of a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d concerning payroll. He said, as set out in this statement by PNG\u2019s Internal Revenue Commission (IRC), that the glitch had its origins in the passing of the Income Tax (2024 Budget) (Amendment) Act 2023 last year. The Act did two things in particular. It made the temporary increase in the tax-free salary threshold, from K17,500 to K20,000, permanent. It had been due to end on December 31. The Act also removed the dependant rebate, which provided tax concessions to PNG taxpayers with dependants who met certain criteria . Mr Marape has said the underpayments were a result of the government\u2019s Alesco payroll system not accounting for the extension in the K20,000 tax-free threshold.  Therefore it reverted to K17,500 on January 1. The government has said the issue has been fixed and that any money owed will be paid in the next pay cycle. Much of the violence occurred in Port Moresby, the capital. The government said the removal of the dependant rebate was also yet to be factored into the payroll system, so did not contribute to the underpayments. Then on Friday, with police and security forces attempting to restore calm, a mysterious post appeared across social media (examples here , here , here and here ). The viral post, signed off by an \u201cAlesco System Analyst\u201d, claimed that the government\u2019s explanation of a glitch was \u201csimply a cover story\u201d. AAP FactCheck contacted Alesco to ask if anyone at the company was behind the post. No response had been received by the time of publication. Regardless of who was behind the post, information contained within it is false. Crucially, it states that the discontinuation of the dependant rebate will result in a reduction in take-home pay for those earning  K20,000 and under. Specifically, it claims their tax bill will increase by \u201cno less than K67 per fortnight\u201d. This is false. As workers earning K20,000 are under the tax-free threshold, they are not taxed in the first place. Therefore they are not eligible for tax rebates. This is explained in this IRC tax calculation document from last year. The post also claims that those earning above K490 per fortnight will see a tax deduction reflected on their payslip from January 1. This is also false as K490 per fortnight equates to an annual salary well below the K20,000 tax-free threshold. Dr Bal Kama , adjunct assistant professor at the University of Canberra and a PNG constitutional law expert, told AAP FactCheck by email that income tax increases can only be made through acts of parliament, which have not occurred. Therefore the many posts ( example here ) stating that the government has legislated an income tax increase are false. Some posts falsely referred to legislation as proof of the major tax hike. Posts pointing to the Income Tax (2024 Budget) (Amendment) Act 2023 legislation as proof of an income tax hike (examples here , here and here ) are also false. As outlined above, this Act concerns the increase in the K20,000 tax-free threshold and the removal of the dependant rebate. It does not include a rise in rates of income tax. \u201cTax and income issues are only part of the picture behind the events that unfolded,\u201d Dr Kama told AAP FactCheck . \u201cThere are some deep-seated issues that were able to compel key embodiments of rule of law, the police and soldiers, to act.\u201d Professor Anthony Regan , a constitutional law expert at the Australian National University who has lived and worked in PNG for nearly 20 years, agreed, saying any suggestion of a reduction in income had the potential to spark anger. \u201cThere are very low wages in PNG,\u201d Prof Regan told AAP FactCheck . \u201cThose who are employed are still living hand-to-mouth and most people are unemployed.\u201d The Verdict The claim Papua New Guinea residents on K20,000 a year will receive less take-home pay because the dependant tax rebates have been discontinued is false. The rebates were only available to taxpayers, and workers earning under K20,000 do not pay tax in PNG. It is one of several false claims in posts made in relation to the disorder in PNG. Other false claims include that the government has legislated a rise in income tax rates. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "A prominent pro-Israel activist has posted footage that he claims is further proof that Palestinians are exaggerating injuries in the current conflict. Yoseph Haddad published an explainer video about the release of Palestinian prisoner Mohammed Nazzal and the various claims the teenager has made in the weeks since. Nazzal, who was released from an Israeli prison during the prisoner-hostage exchange , claims guards beat him and left him with fractured hands. But Haddad says footage of his release, in which he boards a Red Cross bus, debunks the claims. However, the video has been selectively edited to show a different prisoner boarding the bus. The edited footage is being promoted by pro-Israel activist Yoseph Haddad \u201cThat\u2019s definitely one of the best Palestinian propaganda videos. But because they were caught lying, it turned into the stupidest video ever,\u201d Haddad says in his November 30 Instagram video . He also posted the video on Facebook. Haddad claims it is the latest example of Pallywood in action during the current conflict. Pallywood (sometimes written Palywood, Paliwood or Palliwood) is a portmanteau of the words \u2018Palestine\u2019 and \u2018Hollywood\u2019 to suggest Palestinian crisis actors are feigning injury and death to exaggerate civilian casualties in the conflict. \u201cHe told the press how Israel \u2026 break both of his hands,\u201d \u00a0Haddad says in the video alongside footage of a heavily bandaged Nazzal. \u201cWait there\u2019s only one problem,\u201d Haddad then says. \u201cThe terrorist boy with broken hands was filmed at the moment of release from prison, showing him healthy and intact without casts, using his hands freely.\u201d The video shows footage of Nazzal, dressed in a grey top and pants, preparing to board the bus. The footage then cuts to a person dressed in the same clothing, pulling himself onto the bus using his arms. Haddad continues: \u201cMohammed, now that you are out of jail you can start your new career as an actor in Paliwood. You will be a superstar\u201d. But the footage has been selectively edited. The unedited version reveals that the man whom Haddad claims is Nazzal is actually another prisoner. The cropped clip used in Haddad\u2019s video. The wider shot shows Nazzal (right) and the unidentified prisoner boarding the bus (circled). At the start of the full clip, Nazzal is seen approaching the bus with his arms unbandaged and by his side. After confirming his identity (seven-second mark) he goes towards the bus (18 seconds). At this point, the prisoner in front of Nazzal can be seen preparing to board. This unidentified prisoner, whom Haddad claims is Nazzal in his video, then climbs the stairs of the bus with the help of his arms (24 seconds). Nazzal follows (33 seconds). His hands don\u2019t make contact with the bus as he climbs the first two steps. His left hand does make contact as he rounds the corner and walks towards the seats. However, it is unclear how much \u2013 if any weight \u2013 the hand is bearing. The BBC reported it was provided with X-rays from Palestinian doctors who said they had examined Nazzal following his release. The broadcaster said it showed the images to two doctors in the UK, who confirmed they showed fractures in both hands. The Israeli authorities have disputed Nazzal\u2019s claims, saying he was examined before his release and no medical issues were discovered. AAP FactCheck has debunked several \u201cPallywood\u201d claims in recent months, here , here , here , and here . The Verdict The claim a Palestinian prisoner seen in a video using his hands to pull himself onto a bus is a teenager who says he has two broken hands is false. The video has been selectively edited. The man claimed to be Mohammed Nazzal is actually another unidentified prisoner. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "It is being claimed a new agreement between the Australian government and the US has given the UN the power to confiscate 30 per cent of our land. The claim relates to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Australia\u2019s Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) . The claim is false. There is nothing in the MOU or related agreements and frameworks that relate to ceding land to anyone, let alone the UN. Nor does it in any way give the UN power to confiscate land. Maria Zeee , a prominent spreader of misinformation, made the claim in an Instagram post (screenshot here ) which featured one of her appearances on US conspiracy theorist Stew Peters \u2018 show. The post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cNow we know why Albanese was in the U.S! The EPA and the Australian Department of Climate Change have signed a NEW, JOINT Memorandum of Understanding which will eventually lead to confiscation of at least 30% of U.S. and Australian land and hand it over to the United Nations.\u201d The claim conflates a number of different environmental announcements. In the full interview , she expands on the claim and cites several environmental agreements and frameworks. Ms Zeee makes reference to the MOU before mentioning the US and Australia\u2019s existing \u201c natural capital accounting \u201d program which she claims could result in water being restricted to households based on their social credit scores. She then says the two countries will meet next year to discuss progress at Sydney\u2019s Global Nature Positive Summit and that a webpage associated with the summit features information on the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework . This framework, agreed at the 15th Conference of Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, features several environmental goals, including what is more commonly known as the 30\u00d730 target . The target is for nations to designate 30 per cent of their land and water as protected areas by 2030. This is the source of Ms Zeee\u2019s 30 per cent confiscated land figure. She tells her followers that the UN is lying about its goal being to protect the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s actually about stripping countries of 30 per cent of ownership of their land and handing it over to the UN under the name of conservation,\u201d she says. The confused claim conflates several separate announcements about the environment. Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek signed the MOU back in October 2022. Notably, she suggests that the MOU is ultimately linked to the 30\u00d730 target, which will lead to the UN confiscating land. The MOU, which can be viewed in full here , doesn\u2019t mention the 30\u00d730 target or have anything to do with handing land to the UN. It certainly does not give the UN any power to confiscate land. Instead, it sets out provisions for sharing knowledge on environmental issues and information between the two countries. Contrary to the claim, the MOU also explicitly states in Section 10 that it does not create obligations under domestic or international law, nor does it create any \u201clegally enforceable rights or benefits\u201d. \u201c(The MOU) will set up a new mechanism for the exchange of information about major environmental issues including national environmental laws and regulations, building a circular economy so that we divert more from landfill and sharing ideas to protect and repair nature,\u201d a DCCEEW representative told AAP FactCheck in an email. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) sets out several goals and targets, of which the 30\u00d730 goal is one. But nothing in the framework that has anything to do with ceding land to the UN either. Huge swathes of Australia\u2019s land and waters are already protected areas. As previous AAP FactCheck debunks have explained , such targets and frameworks do not give the UN power to demand member states to do anything, let alone hand over their land or territory. Additionally, the GBF specifically states that the target is \u201cnon-punitive\u201d and respects \u201cnational sovereignty\u201d (Section J, p13-14). The full video features several other spurious claims relating to common themes of disinformation including smart cities and pedophile rings run by global elites. Ms Zeee also declares the UN a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d in the video and repeats a previously debunked claim about the UN\u2019s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . The Verdict The claim a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Australia and the US will give the UN the power to confiscate 30 per cent of land is false. The claim conflates a number of separate environment-related announcements. However, the MOU has nothing to do with the target of designating 30 per cent of Australia\u2019s land and water as protected areas by 2030. Nor does the agreement give the UN the power to compel member states to do anything \u2013 let alone hand over territory. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

In the December 2019 episode, Rogan alludes to a C-SPAN clip (archived here) in which Rumsfeld mentions the $2.3 trillion figure. \"Our financial systems are decades-old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,\" he said during a September 10, 2001 press conference at the Pentagon (archived here), which AFP covered at the time. \"We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it's stored on dozens of different technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.\" The next day, 184 people were killed after Al-Qaeda pilots slammed a hijacked airliner into the Pentagon's southwest corner. More than 2,700 died that same day in attacks on New York City's World Trade Center, as well as 40 people aboard a fourth hijacked flight that crashed in the state of Pennsylvania after the passengers and crew fought to try and take back control of the plane. There is ample evidence of how 9/11 unfolded -- including photos of plane debris at the Pentagon. But conspiracy theorists have long fabricated other explanations; claims about unaccounted money have circulated online since at least 2005. The most recent posts are also inaccurate. While Rumsfeld did lament bureaucratic red tape and the lack of audit trails for $2.3 trillion the day before 9/11, it was not the first time -- and he did not say the money was \"missing.\" \"The DOD had been reporting large unsupported adjustments for two decades,\" said Mark Skidmore, an economics professor at Michigan State University who has researched the Pentagon's accounting gaps. The DOD inspector general first noted in a February 2000 audit report (archived here) that, in accounting entries from the 1999 fiscal year, $2.3 trillion \"was not supported by adequate audit trails or sufficient evidence to determine their validity.\" The Associated Press covered the report's release, saying the Pentagon \"could not show receipts\" for those adjustments to its financial ledgers (archived here). Nearly a year later, then-Senator Robert Byrd mentioned the findings during Rumsfeld's nomination hearing (archived here). \"That audit report found that out of $7.6 trillion in department-level accounting entries, $2.3 trillion in entries either did not contain adequate documentation or were improperly reconciled or were made to force buyer and seller data to agree,\" the West Virginia Democrat said in January 2001. Neta Crawford, co-director of the Costs of War project at Brown University, told AFP in a September 12 email that the Pentagon \"has famously poor accounting.\" Since the 1990s, federal law has required all government agencies to prepare financial statements and have them audited -- including the DOD. But the department could not ready its balance sheets until 2017. One year later, the Pentagon failed the first full-scale audit in its history. Nor has the DOD passed an audit since, in part due to its bureaucracy, the diversity of its assets and its sheer size. Congress generally allocates more than half of its discretionary budget to national defense. However, the Pentagon said in May 2019 that its first audit \"did not identify instances where DOD does not know where obligated dollars are being spent.\" \"The audit findings highlight the fact that the department doesn't always record the receipt of goods and services in a timely and accurate manner in the appropriate property management systems,\" the agency says on its website (archived here). AFP reached out to the Pentagon for additional comment, but a response was not forthcoming. Claims about missing money play into long-debunked theories that the federal government orchestrated 9/11 -- fueled in part by the fact that 34 members of the Pentagon's Program and Budget and Managerial Accounting divisions were killed (archived here). The bipartisan 9/11 Commission Report (archived here), is the most comprehensive account of the terrorist attacks. \"The 9/11 attack was driven by Osama Bin Ladin,\" the executive summary says (archived here). Based on more than 2.5 million pages of documents and interviews with more than 1,200 people in 10 countries, the report details how the former Al-Qaeda leader and his advisers first agreed on the idea to hijack passenger planes in the late 1990s. By 2000, several young Arabs who would later carry out the 9/11 attacks had arrived in the United States, with some conducting pilot training. The plot culminated more than a year later when 19 hijackers passed through airport security checkpoints and \"took over the four flights, taking advantage of air crews and cockpits that were not prepared for the contingency of suicide hijacking,\" according to the 9/11 Commission Report. Within hours, US intelligence officials had linked the ensuing attacks to Al-Qaeda. Bin Laden himself later claimed responsibility. \"Since the plotters were flexible and resourceful, we cannot know whether any single step or series of steps would have defeated them,\" the report's executive summary says. \"What we can say with confidence is that none of the measures adopted by the US government from 1998 to 2001 disturbed or even delayed the progress of the Al-Qaeda plot.\" AFP has fact-checked other false and misleading claims about 9/11 here and here.",

        "doc": "\"A video from a Parking lot Camera at the Pentagon, before they could get to and suppress the footage,\" says Ed Strachar, an author and self-described \"spirit healer,\" in a September 11, 2023 Facebook post. \"They claimed a Plane struck the Pentagon. This Exposes their bold faced lies.\" But the clip itself contradicts Strachar's claim. The video in his post shows what appears to be a police car driving near the Pentagon, home of the US Department of Defense. But around 25 seconds into the clip, an object -- known to be the plane -- strikes the building, causing a massive fireball. Despite the evidence, other posts sharing the mischaracterized footage have circulated on Instagram, TikTok, and X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Cruise missile,\" says a September 11 post. The claims spiked online on the 22nd anniversary of 9/11, a day of terror when Al-Qaeda devotees hijacked planes and crashed them into New York City's World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A fourth jet crashed in the state of Pennsylvania after the passengers and crew fought back. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks -- the \"single largest loss of life resulting from a foreign attack on American soil,\" according to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum (archived here). Despite ample first-hand evidence of how 9/11 unfolded, conspiracy theorists have long fabricated other explanations. AFP has previously debunked claims that no planes hit the Twin Towers and allegations of a government cover-up. The more recent posts are similarly inaccurate. A reverse image search indicates the video was originally released in May 2006 following a Freedom of Information Act request (archived here) from Judicial Watch, which AFP covered at the time. The American conservative activist group posted the clip on YouTube (archived here) with a caption saying the parking lot security footage shows \"American Airlines Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon.\" \"We fought hard to obtain this video because we felt that it was very important to complete the public record with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11,\" said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. \"Finally, we hope that this video will put to rest the conspiracy theories involving American Airlines Flight 77.\" Fitton republished the video September 11, 2023 on X (archived here). American Airlines Flight 77 departed Washington Dulles International Airport at 8:20 am on September 11, 2001, according to the bipartisan 9/11 Commission Report (archived here). \"The hijacking began between 8:51 and 8:54,\" the report says, noting that is when the aircraft deviated from its route. \"At 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately 530 miles per hour. All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed.\" Based on more than 2.5 million pages of documents and interviews with more than 1,200 people in 10 countries, the 9/11 Commission Report is the most comprehensive account of the attacks. Its description of the crash at the Pentagon is supplemented by photo and video evidence of the damage, some of which shows plane debris. AFP contacted the Pentagon for comment, but a response was not forthcoming.",

        "doc": "It is being claimed that the Israeli prime minister has accused the International Criminal Court (ICC) of \u201canti-Semitism\u201d after the body alleged his country had committed war crimes during the current conflict. This is false. Benjamin Netanyahu made the comments almost three years ago in response to a 2021 ICC ruling. While the judicial body has said it is investigating allegations of crimes, it has not accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza. Posts linking Netanyahu\u2019s 2021 comments to the current conflict have appeared across Facebook, ( here , here , here and here ) as well as on X ( here ) and TikTok ( here ). Many of the posts feature the text: \u201cAfter murdering more than 17,000 people in 2 months including more than 5000 children and hundreds of United Nations workers and medical staff, Netanyahu is outraged with the international community and the International Criminal Court for accusing Israel of war crimes.\u201d Social media users claim Netanyahu\u2019s speech was in response to a recent ICC accusation. Most either appear alongside the video or stills of Netanyahu\u2019s 2021 broadcast. Some also include graphic images and videos of injured and dead Palestinians. \u201cWhen the ICC investigates Israel for fake war crimes this is pure anti-Semitism,\u201d Netanyahu says in the video . \u201cThe court established to prevent atrocities like the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people, is now targeting the one state of the Jewish people.\u201d The Netanyahu speech is genuine, with the video and transcript available from the Israeli government. His comments were widely reported by international media (see here and here ) at the time. His February 2021 comments concerned a ruling by the ICC that it had jurisdiction to investigate alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967 (see section 118, page 51 ). The ruling led to the opening of a formal investigation into the \u201csituation in Palestine\u201d , which continues today. ICC chief prosecutor Karim Ahmed Khan has said the investigation is ongoing. On November 17, 2023, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said his office had received a referral from five countries to investigate whether crimes have been committed by Israel in the Palestinian Occupied Territories since October 7. On that date, Hamas attacked Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1200 people with almost 240 taken hostage, according to the UN citing reports from Israeli authorities . Israel\u2019s subsequent attacks have resulted in the deaths of 21,100 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry , and 300 people in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the UN . The UN also says almost 1.9 million people have been displaced across Gaza since October 7. In his November 17 statement , Khan noted his office was already investigating the situation in the Palestinian territories over possible crimes committed since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. However, the ICC is still investigating and hasn\u2019t accused or charged Israel with any crimes related to the 2023 hostilities as of December 29. The Verdict The claim that the Israeli prime minister has used a broadcast to rail against the International Criminal Court (ICC) after the body accused his country of war crimes during the 2023 conflict in Gaza is false. His speech criticising the ICC was made in February 2021 after the court ruled it had jurisdiction to probe war crimes cases in the Palestinian Occupied Territories since 2014. While ICC prosecutors are investigating the 2023 conflict as part of that probe, they haven\u2019t accused or charged Israel with any crimes. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "\"Oh My God Save The Country of Libya. Ameen,\" reads text on a Facebook reel shared here on September 13, 2023. The clip -- viewed over 4,000 times -- shows a mudslide ripping down a hill dotted with buildings, toppling power lines and engulfing infrastructure. The video was also shared with similar claims on Facebook here and here, where it was viewed more than 570,000 times. On September 10, torrential rains from Storm Daniel burst two dams upstream from Libya's coastal city of Derna, sending a wall of water crashing through the city centre that razed entire neighbourhoods. The latest catastrophe to strike the oil-rich North African country has unleashed a global aid effort as the flash flood killed at least 3,000 people, with thousands more missing. The clip circulating online, however, is unrelated to the disaster in Libya. A reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the clip led to a video compilation posted on YouTube on July 3, 2021 by Japanese newspaper Sankei News (archived link). The first clip in the compilation is a longer version of the footage used in the false posts, and is credited to wire agency EyePress (archived link). The video's caption indicates it shows a mudslide sweeping through the Izusan neighbourhood of Atami, a town in Japan's Shizuoka prefecture, on July 3, 2021. AFP reported that torrents of mud crashed through part of the town following days of heavy rain. The town, around 90 kilometres (55 miles) southwest of Tokyo, saw rainfall of 313 millimetres in the 48 hours prior to the mudslide -- higher than the average monthly total for July of 242.5 millimetres, according to public broadcaster NHK. Other international news organisations also covered the mudslide in reports here, here and here that contained similar footage and photos (archived links here, here and here). A keyword search on Google led to an article published on the Climate Adaptation Platform site on July 8, 2021 that includes a map -- credited to the Japan's Geospatial Information Authority -- showing the landslide's trajectory (archived links here and here). A subsequent search on the Geospatial Information Authority website led to an article with several images and maps detailing the mudslide (archived link). This information allowed AFP to pinpoint the location shown in the video circulating on social media on Google Maps (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the false posts (left) and the location as seen in Google Maps (right), with a distinctive red building highlighted in both by AFP: AFP has previously debunked misinformation around the Libyan floods including posts in Spanish that have misrepresented the Japan mudslide video here.",

        "doc": "\"The Israeli police beat and drove out Orthodox believers and bishops who were going to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, earlier this morning in this manner,\" reads the Amharic-language post published on October 20, 2023. It indirectly links the video to the Israel-Gaza conflict by adding that \"Palestine was home to all religions, where Christians, Muslims and Jews live together in harmony before it was colonised by Israel\". The post contains a 30-second clip and has been shared more than 110 times. Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping more than 220 others, according to Israeli officials (archived here). The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says the strikes have now killed over 7,300 people, mainly civilians and many of them children. The UN has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire (archived here) in the Gaza Strip as conditions in the enclave continued to deteriorate from catastrophic shortages after nearly three weeks of bombardment. However, the footage of Israeli police and Orthodox Christians was filmed months before war broke out in October 2023. AFP Fact Check used the video verification tool InVID-WeVerify to conduct reverse image searches on keyframes from the footage. We established that the video was originally published on the YouTube channel of TRT World, a Turkish state-owned broadcaster, on April 15, 2023 (archived here). \"Israeli forces attack Christians ahead of the Holy Fire ceremony,\" reads the video's English-language caption. The full video, which is originally 1'24\" long, shows security forces forcefully stopping people from passing through a narrow street. Thousands of Orthodox Christians perform the so-called Holy Fire rite every year at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (archived here), the ancient site located in the Old City of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, where Jesus Christ was buried and resurrected, according to Christian teachings. The church has long been a major pilgrimage centre for Christians. The ritual is performed on the Saturday before Easter. Worshippers wait for a \"divine flame\" from heaven with which they light candles, marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ (archived here). For security reasons, Israeli authorities restricted the number of attendants on April 15, 2023 for the second consecutive year, according to AFP (archived here). This year's ceremony had followed deadly attacks and clashes in Israel, east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, and cross-border fire days earlier between Israeli forces and militants in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria.",

Indonesia's General Elections Commission (KPU) said in January 2020 that more than 5,100 election workers had fallen sick and 894 had died (archived link). The poll was the world's biggest single-day election as Indonesia's 193 million registered voters had the chance to cast their ballots in presidential and parliamentary elections on the same day for the first time (archived link). Around six million election workers were deployed to 810,000 polling stations to handle the vote (archived link). The country's next general elections -- scheduled for mid-February 2024 -- are poised to be just as large (archived link). According to the KPU, more than 204 million people will be eligible to vote for the country's president, legislators and councillors on the same day (archived link). Similar videos were shared in posts on YouTube, TikTok, video-sharing app SmackVideo and here on X, formerly Twitter, racking up more than 180,000 views in total. The IDI, however, did not conclude that election workers in 2019 had died from poisoning. The video shared in the false post consists of clips from two genuine news reports. A combination of reverse-image and keyword searches on Google found that the first clip was taken from a news report posted on YouTube by Indonesian broadcaster Kompas TV on May 13, 2019 (archived link). It is titled, \"469 election polling station workers died, the cause was not exhaustion\". \"The Indonesian Medical Association (IDI) stated that the main cause of death for hundreds of polling station workers after the April 17 elections was not fatigue,\" reads part of the video's Indonesian-language caption. \"Prior illnesses, such as heart and neurovascular diseases, triggered the fatalities of election workers, according to the IDI chairman during a public discussion at the IDI office.\" The IDI event was also reported by other media here and here (archived links here and here). There is no mention of poisoning in the Kompas TV report or other media reports about the IDI event. The medical association has also denied the claim shared in the false post. \"IDI never made that statement,\" its spokesman Halik Malik told AFP on August 23, 2023. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video used in the false post (left) and the Kompas TV video (right): Another combination of reverse image and keyword searches on Google found the second clip -- published by Indonesian TV station iNews on YouTube on May 10, 2019 -- features a different press conference by another doctors' group (archived link). The clip was also published on the iNews website here (archived link). Its Indonesian-language headline reads, \"Unnatural deaths of polling station workers, 42 doctors demand government to form a fact-finding team\". The iNews report reads: \"A total of 42 cross-disciplinary physicians make a statement on the deaths of many polling station workers. The doctors from the National Health Community Concern (KKPB) group demand the government set up a fact-finding team.\" The KKPB's press conference was also covered by other media here and here on May 9, 2019 (archived links here and here). There is also no mention of poisoning as a possible cause of death in the iNews report or the reports from other media. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the false post (left) and the iNews video (right): Budiawan, a chemical toxicology expert and senior lecturer at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Indonesia, told AFP the claim election workers died from poisoning is baseless (archived link). \"It is not clear what poisonous substances are being claimed. There is no evidence, only assumptions or conjectures,\" he said on August 25, 2023. An Indonesian Health Ministry statement in mid-May 2019 said most of those who died were between 50 and 70 years old (archived link). It further said that based on the ministry's investigation, the deaths were caused by assorted illnesses, including myocardial infarction, diabetes, asthma, stroke, respiratory failure, meningitis, tuberculosis, sepsis, kidney failure, hypertension and multi-organ failure, except one fatality caused by an accident. To avoid a similar tragedy, the KPU announced in April 2023 that people applying to become polling station workers for the 2024 election would need to be between the ages of 17 and 55 (archived link). There had not been a maximum age for polling station workers in previous elections.",

        "doc": "\"Breaking News: Two AfganEastern boys living in Gaza caught with a stolen money while trying to escape through Egypt/Gaza border [sic],\" reads a post shared on X, formerly Twitter on October 28, 2023. The term \"Afgan Eastern\" is an ethnic slur referring to Igbos from southeast Nigeria. Shared by a supporter of Nigeria's ruling All Progressives Congress, the claim featuring a two-minute clip has been reposted nearly 200 times. The video shows photos of two men, a box of money, a man raising the Palestinian flag, and a male on-screen narrator. The narrator claims the two \"Nigerians\" were arrested while trying to flee to Egypt for stealing \"$1.6 million from their Palestinian boss lady in Gaza\". He said the men are named \"Chinaza\" and \"Ekperifuna\". Israel has bombarded the Palestinian territory of Gaza since the October 7 attacks by Hamas militants, which killed around 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. More than 8,500 people, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory said in its latest toll (archived here). Weeks of war have displaced more than 1.4 million people as of October 29, 2023, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) (archived here). The UN also warned the civil order was starting to break down after thousands of people ransacked aid warehouses (archived here). However, the video does not show Nigerians arrested after stealing money from their Gazan employer. AFP Fact Check traced the video in the claim to a TikTok account called \"Dagger of Monrovia\", a name visible in the clip. The Liberian TikTok account published the false claim on October 26, 2023. People who commented on the post appeared to believe the allegations. However, using the InVID-WeVerify video verification tool, AFP Fact Check found that the image had been online more than a month before Hamas attacked Israel. The cybercrime police unit in the Indian city of Rachakonda published the photos of the pair (archived here) on X on August 24, 2023. The post also contained an official statement saying the two Nigerian nationals had been arrested in West Delhi on August 15, 2023, for \"duping victims in the guise of sending gift parcels\" (archived here). #Rachakonda cyber crimesarrested two #Nigerian Nationals for making friends on #SocialMedia platforms and duping victims in the guise of sending #Gift parcels. Cr. No. 87/2023 of #RachakondaPoliceCommissionerate@RachakondaCoppic.twitter.com/JCeO8seFeZ The police gave their names as Omenonye Sylvester and Alimeke Endurance Chukkwuka \u2014 not \"Chinaza\" and \"Ekperifuna\". An Indian news outlet also published a story about the arrests (archived here). A reverse image search revealed the photo of the money was posted online at least seven years ago. It was used as cover art for a song published on SoundCloud, an audio-sharing platform, on August 10, 2016 (archived here). The renewed conflict between Israel and Hamas has generated a wave of disinformation online. You can follow our coverage here.",

        "doc": "\u201cZambian President, Hakainde Hichilema, who was voted into office in 2021, announcing his decision not to seek re-election in 2026,\u201d reads a post published on X (formerly Twitter) on October 10, 2023. \u201cExtremely remarkable considering the destructive penchant of African Presidents to cling on to power purposely to loot the public purse,\u201d it adds. The 55-second video shows Hichilema speaking in front of the Zambian flag. The video is slightly blurry and the colours appear to be filtered. Hichilema\u2019s body remains immobile throughout; only his mouth moves. \u201cIt is with the utmost sincerity and a profound sense of duty to our great nation that I announce my decision to not seek re-election in the upcoming general elections of 2026. I believe this decision is in the best interest of our country and its future,\u201d Hichilema purportedly says. The video circulating on social media includes a watermark reading \u201c@zambian_ai\u201d. A keyword search led to a TikTok account that published the video in a post on September 22, 2023. \u201cHakainde Hichilema Declares his Not running for 2026 elections (sic),\u201d reads the caption. The TikTok account features other AI-generated videos, including one published days after Hichilema\u2019s, showing Lungu purportedly declaring his return to \u201cactive politics in the 2026 elections\u201d. \u201cThroughout the video, the entire upper body and neck are perfectly still, which is a typical artefact of this type of deepfake video in which only the head is generated by the AI,\u201d said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and expert in digital forensics, misinformation and image analysis. Farid added: \u201cThere are many individual frames in which the teeth are misformed, which is a typical artefact of this type of deepfake video in which the mouth and teeth are synthesised to be consistent with an audio track.\u201d The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab agreed, saying the video is \u201cdefinitely AI-generated\u201d. \u201cAlthough the audio syncs well with the lip movements, the movement of the rest of the image is what gives it away,\u201d said Jean le Roux, research associate at DFRLab Sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cThis is most likely a still image onto which the motion of the head and face was translated \u2013 a reverse image search of a thumbnail of the video should identify the original picture this was based off,\u201d added le Roux. AFP Fact Check performed a reverse image search and found the original image on Hichilema\u2019s official X account. In the photograph, he is wearing the same tie and navy blazer, the flags in the background fall identically and the folds on the left arm of his blazer are identical (archived here). Matthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, specialising in the detection of falsified images and videos, and fellow expert Tai Nguyen analysed the video using algorithms and software called VideoFACT built under a research project (archived here). \u201cTraces are always introduced when an image or video is captured by a camera, or when it is created by an AI system,\u201d said Stamm. \u201cSimilarly, new forensic traces are introduced into an image or video when editing software or AI systems are used to modify them.\u201d In this case, Stamm said the software identifies the video as a deepfake and highlights the falsified regions in Hichilema's face. The odd movements on Hichilema\u2019s face appear because \u201cdeepfake software often has a hard time mimicking realistic human movement\u201d, Stamm said. He believed that this video was made with \u201ca simplistic system\u201d, such as a consumer-friendly application because more advanced approaches to creating deepfakes currently exist. Zambian police confirmed to AFP Fact Check on October 23, 2023 that they were looking into the video\u2019s creator. \u201cWe are investigating the origin of the video and who is exactly behind its publication. Currently, we are following leads,\u201d said deputy spokesman Danny Mwale. The ruling United Party for National Development (UPND) dismissed the video in a statement published on October 8, 2023, accusing opposition parties of creating it (archived here). \u201cWe understand the desperation of the opposition political parties to an extent where they are now ready to commit criminality against the popularly elected head of state,\u201d it read. \u201cThese rogue elements are creating and circulating fake videos which mimic the president with electronically generated voice intended to mislead the public.\u201d The party warned of legal action and cautioned the public not to circulate the video that \u201cis a clear misrepresentation of president Hichilema\u2019s persona\u201d. Zambia introduced the Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Act 2021, with a range of cyber-related crimes punishable by fines or jail time. As reported by AFP, Hichilema was elected president in 2021 on his sixth attempt for the top job and the third time he had challenged his predecessor Lungu, who then announced his retirement. A president can serve two five-year terms according to Zambia\u2019s Constitution, and Hichilema is still in his first (archived here). Lungu was deemed eligible to run in August 2021, a judgement which contradicted the two-term limitation imposed by the 2016 Zambian constitution in Article 106(3) (archived here, here and here). His eligibility to run in the 2026 elections is not yet clear although Lungu has unofficially hinted at the possibility (archived here and here). AFP Fact Check has debunked a number of AI-generated videos, including one about footballer Lionel Messi and another related to the death of Nigerian Afrobeats star MohBad. AFP Fact Check has created a guide with tips on how to identify AI-generated content, which you can read here.",

        "doc": "\"Imagine attending a rave. Then Hamas parachutes in,\" says text over a clip shared October 8, 2023 to TikTok and Instagram. The video shows paragliders descending over a city at dawn or dusk as onlookers film them on their phones. Other posts with the footage circulated in Hungarian and Korean. In its initial assault, Hamas unleashed a massive rocket barrage and sent fighters by air, land and sea to gun down civilians and take more than 100 hostages, including Americans and other foreigners. Israel officially declared war the following day, and its army later said it struck hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad sites in the Gaza Strip. The conflict had killed thousands by October 11. Hamas has released clips of militants using motorized gliders to fly into Israel, storm military bases and shoot civilians at a music festival in the desert. But the video shared online is not one of them. A reverse image search revealed a matching YouTube video (archived here) uploaded September 29, 2023 with the Arabic title \"Parachute forces in Heliopolis.\" A district of Cairo, Heliopolis is home to the El Nasr football club. One person in the footage is wearing clothing that says \"EL NASR SC.\" AFP geolocated the video shared online to the football club's location in Cairo (archived here). A keyword search for El Nasr surfaced a video tour of the football club on YouTube (archived here). Many details in the footage match those in the clip being misrepresented online, including a red cafe and blue chairs. Using the video tour, AFP determined the exact location where the recording shared online was taken. Both clips show fencing and a large square object that appears to be a digital screen. AFP previously debunked Arabic posts claiming another video showed paragliders tied to the Hamas attacks. The footage was recorded in front of a military academy near the Cairo football field and features similar weather and lightning, suggesting the two clips depict the same event. The Israel-Palestine conflict has led to a torrent of misinformation on social media, including many misrepresented photos and videos. More of AFP's reporting is available here.",

        "doc": "A list of supposed changes to New Zealand welfare benefits, including a cut to Jobseeker payments of more than $NZ60 a week, is circulating on social media. The list is fake. The New Zealand government has told AAP FactCheck none of the changes on the list are set to happen as of April as claimed. In particular, the government instead announced back in December it would index the main benefits to CPI inflation from April 1. The text, which has been widely shared on Facebook \u2013 examples here , here , here , here and here \u2013 \u00a0is claimed to be \u201ca current list of changes confirmed for WINZ benefits\u201d that has been \u201cconfirmed by case manager\u201d. WINZ (Work and Income New Zealand) is the former name of Work and Income , the organisation within the Ministry of Social Development that is responsible for benefits and payments. A supposed list of changes to NZ benefit payments circulating on Facebook is fake. Among the supposed changes listed are (all monetary values are in $NZ): \u2022 \u201cSolo parent benefit increases by $87.40\u201d \u2022 \u201cJob seeker decreases by $62.30 a week\u201d \u2022 \u201cAccommodation supplement max will be decreased by 30%\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe government will sell 40% of government and social housing to investors by 2025\u201d \u2022 \u201cFood grants \u2014 solo people will only be able to apply for $80 every six months; solo parents $100 every six months; family with kids and couple $140 per six months\u201d \u2022 \u201cIn November only 21+ and over can receive the Jobseeker benefit\u201d \u2022 \u201cDrug testing for job seekers will be introduced and benefits reduced for anyone caught\u201d Some Facebook posts, such as here and here , have pointed out that the list is made up and that there is no notification of such changes on the Work and Income website. The Work and Income website shows the current benefit rates: the sole parent support payment , for example, is currently $NZ472.79 after tax and the Jobseeker support payment ranges from $NZ250.63 per week after tax for a single 18-19-year-old person living at home, to $NZ606.86 for a married couple with children. Work and Income also outlines the process for applying for accommodation supplement and food grants and how much applicants are likely to receive. Both the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and the responsible minister have told AAP FactCheck the social media claims are false. MSD acting group general manager Graham Allpress said the ministry was aware of the list on social media. \u201cThere has been no change to current policy,\u201d he said. A fake list of supposed welfare changes also claims \u2013 falsely \u2013 that public housing will be sold. \u201cWhen there are changes to a person\u2019s entitlement MSD communicates directly with the affected client. If a client\u2019s circumstances change they should inform the Ministry.\u201d AAP FactCheck sent the list of purported changes and the social media post to Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston. Ms Upston said: \u201cNone of the changes you have identified are confirmed to happen on 1 April 2024.\u201d The minister said benefit and payment rates were adjusted each year and for 2024 the government would use consumer price index (CPI) data to calculate main benefit payments from April 1. Finance Minister Nicola Willis announced the change back in December. \u201cHow much those on main benefits receive will be determined by the CPI when Stats NZ updates it later this month, subject to Cabinet approval,\u201d Ms Upston said. \u201cBased on the current economic climate, this decision is expected to mean main benefits will be higher on 1 April 2024 than they would have been if we had retained the previous government\u2019s direction to index them to wage growth.\u201d Regarding other changes in the post not covered by the annual adjustment to benefit rates, Ms Upston said: \u201cThe government has not instructed MSD to make them, nor is it actively considering them\u201d. The Verdict The claim NZ Jobseeker benefits will fall by more than $NZ60 as part of a raft of social welfare changes to be introduced as of April is false. The NZ Ministry of Social Development and Social Development and employment minister say the supposed changes are not being implemented and are not being considered. In particular, as announced in December, the government will index main benefits to CPI inflation from April 1.

        "doc": "The video has been viewed more than 1,700 times after it was shared here on TikTok on September 14, 2023. At the start of the video, a female narrator can be heard saying: \"World War III danger. China has readied 140,000 soldiers to attack Indonesia.\" The footage then shows different clips of military parades, as well as a military official delivering a speech in Chinese, with purported Indonesian subtitles that read in part: \"To respond to a conflict between China and Indonesia. And as an anticipation of World War III, we put our military ready for World War III or to fight Indonesia. Around 140,000 soldiers are on alert. \" Indonesian-language sticker text on the video says: \"Beware!!\" and \"This is all because of Joko Widodo,\" referring to the country's president who has been pushing China's investment since he took office in 2014. Indonesia has a history of anti-Chinese sentiments, which have been amplified by misinformation that spread on social media platforms (archived links here and here). The same video has been viewed more than 600 times after it was shared with a similar claim elsewhere on TikTok here and here, on Facebook here and here, and on YouTube here. However, the claim is false. At the six-second mark, the video shows a military official delivering a speech in Chinese. A reverse image search on Google found that the footage was actually filmed when General Wei Fenghe, then Chinese defence minister, took part in the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on June 2, 2019 (archived links here and here). His speech was titled: \"China and International Security Cooperation\" (archived link). In the first 43 seconds of the false video, the Indonesian-language subtitles of Wei's speech read: \"To respond the conflict between China and Indonesia, and anticipate there will be World War 3, we will prepare our military to get ready for World War III or fight Indonesia. Around 140,000 troops are on alert.\" However, the subtitles misrepresented what the Chinese official actually said. Translated from Chinese to English, Wei actually said: \"If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice.\" Then, he continued saying: \"30 years of the leadership of the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] have proven that China has undergone major changes. \"How can we say that China did not handle the Tiananmen incident properly? There is a conclusion of that incident, that is, that incident was political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence,\" he said, referring to the Tiananmen Square crackdown on June 4, 1989 (archived link). According to the organiser's English transcripts of Wei's speech and the subsequent question-and-answer session, Wei did not mention anything about Indonesia (archived links here and here). Below is a screenshot comparison of Wei's speech in the misleading video (left) and the original source (right): Wei's speech was interspersed with different military clips -- none of which were related to the claim about \"140,000 Chinese troops prepared to attack Indonesia\". The scene at 13-second mark of the false video, which shows thousands of soldiers actually shows a military assembly in Hubei Province in 2018, when Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed 7,000 service personnel (archived link). At the 21-second mark, the video shows soldiers from a closer angle. The soldiers were in fact part of an October 2019 military parade in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, to celebrate 70 years of the Chinese Communist Party's rule (archived link). Below are screenshot comparisons between scenes in the misleading video (left) and the original sources (right): Jeeps are seen passing before marching soldiers at the 31-second mark of the clip. This footage is from a military parade held at the Zhurihe training base, in China's Inner Mongolia region, to mark the 90th anniversary of People's Liberation Army in July 2017 (archived link). Military vehicles in front soldiers at the 41-second mark also came from a clip of the 2018 military assembly in Hubei. The clip of Xi shaking hands with soldiers at the 1:21 mark of the false video is from the moment when he inspected a joint battle command centre in April 2016 (archived link). Below are screenshot comparisons between scenes in the misleading video (left) and the original sources (right): Other scenes in the video, such as Xi inspecting troops and soldiers clapping, are taken, respectively, from the 2017 parade at the Zhurihe training base and Xi's 2018 visit in Hubei (archived links here and here). China and Indonesia are not at war. In July 2023, the leaders of the two nations expressed commitment to deepen ties at a meeting in the Chinese city of Chengdu (archived link). Two months later, while attending the ASEAN summit in Jakarta, Chinese Premier Li Qiang joined Indonesian Senior Minister Luhut Pandjaitan to ride the new high-speed train -- part of China-backed infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian country (archived link). AFP previously debunked false claims that China sent soldiers to Indonesia and that local police officers spoke Chinese.",

        "doc": "\"Canadian Gov't Admit 74% of Triple Vaccinated Now Have VAIDS,\" says the headline of an October 1, 2023 article from The People's Voice, a website AFP has repeatedly fact-checked for promoting false and misleading claims. The report is based on another story from The Expose with the headline: \"Government of Canada data is truly terrifying; suggesting the Triple Vaccinated have developed 'AIDS' & are now 5.1x more likely to die of Covid-19 than the Unvaccinated.\" Additional articles and screenshots of their claims spread across platforms, including Reddit, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook -- including in French. Brexit party politician Jim Ferguson amplified the claim on X, formerly known as Twitter. The posts are the latest in a flood of misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines, which health authorities around the world continue to recommend to prevent death and severe illness. \"These claims are false,\" Health Canada said in a statement emailed to AFP on October 5, 2023. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, is a chronic condition caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said October 10 that it \"would not be possible for a Covid-19 vaccine to cause AIDS,\" as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) shots do not use a live virus to trigger an immune response and viral vector jabs include \"a harmless virus (in this case, an adenovirus) as a delivery system.\" \"To date, no reports of AIDS following Covid-19 vaccines have been submitted to PHAC,\" the agency said by email. Independent experts say VAIDS is not a real condition. AFP first reported on the term \"vaccine-acquired immune deficiency syndrome\" in 2021 after the group America's Frontline Doctors included it in a false article. At the time, Jason McKnight, clinical assistant professor at the Texas A&M College of Medicine, told AFP: \"There is no such thing as vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or VAIDS.\" The same holds true in 2023. \"There is no VAIDS,\" said Rachel Roper, professor of microbiology and immunology at East Carolina University, in an October 5 email. \"All data worldwide show that Covid vaccines save lives and do not increase deaths.\" To support their claims, the articles analyzed government data on the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Canada in January and February 2022 -- when the Omicron variant was circulating widely. What Canada's data actually shows is that the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines wanes over time and that the initial jabs were less effective against Omicron. \"Evidence suggests that while two doses of vaccine may not provide good protection against getting infected, a two-dose primary series still provides good protection against hospitalization,\" PHAC said in a January 2022 statement (archived here). \"Encouragingly, the latest evidence indicates that a third dose improves protection against both infection and hospitalization due to the Omicron variant.\" More recently, PHAC told AFP in its October 10 email that it had not received reports from international regulators or other health authorities that vaccines can suppress the immune system. \"With billions of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered to individuals across the world, real-world data strongly suggest that Covid-19-vaccinated individuals are not immunocompromised following vaccination,\" PHAC said. Canada recommends a primary series of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines to individuals six months and older. A first booster dose is recommended for those older than five. \"Booster doses provides (sic) additional protection, including against severe disease,\" Health Canada says on its website (archived here). \"However, the duration of protection is currently unknown, and the absolute benefit of additional booster doses will depend on the residual protection from the previous booster dose and on the level of circulating disease in the community.\" More of AFP's reporting on vaccine misinformation is available here.",

The post includes a clip of someone filming inside a house during what appears to be an earthquake. Other versions of the footage circulated on YouTube after a powerful earthquake struck 45 miles southwest of tourist hub Marrakesh on September 8, wiping out entire villages in the hills of the Atlas mountains. Nearly 3,000 people have been killed. But the video shared on social media is old and unrelated to the disaster. A reverse image search surfaced a January 2022 Facebook post crediting the video to \"gingatandx.\" AFP matched the username to an X account that posted the video with a Japanese caption on January 21 of that year (archived here). \u5730\u9707\u6016\u304b\u3063\u305f\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u3053\u308c\u3067\u9707\u5ea65\u5f37\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002\u3002\u3002\u30ad\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u306b\u3042\u3063\u305f\u307b\u3093\u3060\u3057\u306e\u74f6\u3082\u9a5a\u3044\u3066\u8ee2\u304c\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u7b11\u7b11#\u5730\u9707pic.twitter.com/YgHG9kphWY The post coincides with the date of an earthquake in southwest Japan that caused minor injuries, but no major damage. The X account's bio says it is based in the Oita prefecture. The account also links to a YouTube channel in which the same home interior appears in another video posted a year before the earthquake clip. AFP has debunked other claims about the Morocco earthquake here.",

        "doc": "\"Nothing is more clear than that!!! A Hamas missile hits the hospital in Gaza...\" says an October 17, 2023 post sharing the clip on X, formerly known as Twitter. Similar posts spread on X, TikTok and other platforms more than a week after Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group carried out an unprecedented October 7 assault on the country. The Palestinian fighters killed more than 1,400 people and took some 199 hostages, marking the worst attack in Israeli history. In response, Israel cut off food, water and fuel supplies to Gaza, the densely populated, impoverished territory governed by Hamas, which has been under a blockade for years. Israeli air strikes have also reduced neighborhoods to rubble and killed at least 3,785 people as of October 19, according to the health ministry. The October 17 rocket strike on a hospital elevated international concern and sparked protests worldwide. The blast left scores of bodies and charred cars at the Ahli Arab hospital compound in northern Gaza, AFP images show. But both sides have traded blame for the bloody carnage, though neither the provenance of the strike nor the death toll could be immediately or independently verified. Hamas charged that Israel hit the hospital during its massive bombing campaign, and Gaza's health ministry put the death toll at 471. Israel blamed a misfired rocket from Islamic Jihad -- the second-largest armed group in Gaza -- by pointing to the absence of a large impact crater typical of its air strikes and insisting that fuel from an errant rocket had exploded. President Joe Biden and US intelligence have backed Israel's account. An Israeli army spokesman also disputed Hamas's casualty count, and a senior European intelligence source told AFP he believed a maximum of 50 people were killed. Hamas has dismissed Israel's position, saying its \"outrageous lies do not deceive anyone.\" Despite posts claiming otherwise, the video circulating online does not provide answers -- while captured in Gaza, it is more than a year old. Reverse image searches reveal the same footage circulated on X, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms as early as August 6, 2022 (archived here, here, here, here and here). Israeli journalists and the nation's public broadcaster KAN were among those who shared it (archived here, here and here). The posts say the footage shows a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket near the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4: \u05d1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05db\u05da \u05e9\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2'\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d2'\u05d9\u05d4\u05d0\u05d3 | \u05ea\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc@AmichaiStein1@ItayBlumentalpic.twitter.com/FpeLkL6FYl AFP could not independently verify the source of the clip or the specific missile it shows, but Google Maps Street View imagery from Gaza appears to match some of the buildings (archived here). Israel and Islamic Jihad exchanged blame for an explosion near Jabalia that killed civilians, including children, on August 6, 2022 -- the day the video appeared online. Israel had been targeting Islamic Jihad positions but denied responsibility for the strike, insisting that a rocket fired by the militant group had fallen short. The country's forces said they were not firing on the area at the time and posted footage and a radar tracking map they said showed the failed rocket (archived here, here and here). Residents who witnessed the 2022 blast and spoke to AFP at the time said they believed it was the result of an errant militant rocket. Amnesty International, a global non-governmental organization focused on human rights, also interviewed locals and concluded a Palestinian misfire was to blame (archived here). AFP has debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war here.",

        "doc": "\"Muslims in Morocco continued their congregational prayer when the earthquake struck,\" says the Indonesian-language caption of a Facebook post uploaded on September 10, 2023. The post features a one-minute 37-second video showing dozens of people praying in rows. At the 32-second mark, the lights in the room start to flicker and eventually go out, activating the camera's night vision. The video gets shaky but no one leaves the room and they continue with their prayers. The Indonesian-language sticker text overlaid to the video says: \"Seconds before earthquake struck Morocco. WHILE THEY ARE PRAYING\". Another sticker text on the video, written in Arabic, says: \"Watch the worshippers in the mosque the moment the earthquake hit Morocco.\" The video surfaced shortly after a powerful earthquake killed 2,900 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Muslim-majority Morocco. The 6.8-magnitude earthquake, which hit Al-Haouz province south of tourist hub Marrakesh on September 8, 2023, was the country's strongest on record. The video has racked up over 12 million combined views after it was shared with a similar false claim on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok here and here, SnackVideo and X, formerly Twitter. Similar posts also circulated in Serbian and Arabic. Combined reverse image and keyword searches on Google and Yandex found the video has previously circulated in news reports about a massive quake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023. Al Jazeera Syria published the footage on Facebook on February 26, 2023, with an Arabic-language caption that reads: \"The video documents the first moments of the Hatay earthquake on February 20 at Al-Farouq Mosque in the city of Al-Dana in Idlib\" (archived link). Hatay is a province in southern Turkey, near the Syrian border, while Al-Dana is a town in Idlib governorate in Syria's north. On February 20, 2023, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake rocked Turkey's southern province of Hatay and northern Syria, killing six people and sparking fresh panic after a massive February 6 tremor left over 45,000 dead in both countries, AFP reported. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the false post (left) and the genuine video from Al Jazeera Syria (right): The video also circulated widely in February 2023 news reports here and here as well as on social media posts here and here about the Syria earthquake, seven months before the one in Morocco (archived links here, here, here and here). Turkey-based media organisation Yeni Safak said the video shows surveillance footage from the Al-Farouq Mosque in Al-Dana, Syria. The interior of the mosque seen in the video corresponds to earlier footage of the Al-Farouq Mosque broadcast by Al Jazeera Mubasher on Facebook on April 2, 2022 (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the false post (left) and footage of the mosque from Al Jazeera Mubasher (right), with corresponding features marked by AFP: AFP has debunked misinformation around the Morocco earthquake here and here.",

        "doc": "Federal Labor MPs are heralding a new agreement with Western Australia\u2019s government which they say will result in schools being fully funded for the first time. The fully funded claim refers to the School Resource Standard (SRS), a calculation based on the landmark 2011 review of school funding , commonly known as the Gonski Review . The claim is unproven. Labor is yet to confirm if it will remove a provision that allows states to include non-SRS spending as part of its SRS commitment. At present, this can be up to four per cent of the total SRS figure \u2013 potentially leaving schools only 96 per cent funded. Several Labor figures have made the claim following federal Education Minister Jason Clare announcing the agreement alongside WA counterpart Tony Buti at a press conference in Perth on January 31. Speaking to Greg Jennett on @abcnews about the historic agreement signed today to fully fund all WA public schools. pic.twitter.com/n0hGZleBk2 \u2014 Jason Clare MP (@JasonClareMP) January 31, 2024 In an ABC TV interview , Mr Clare stated the agreement would get WA public schools \u201cto that full funding level that David Gonski talked about all those years ago\u201d. Federal Labor MP for Perth Patrick Gorman repeated the claim in a post on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cI am proud that WA is the first state to sign with the Federal Government to provide 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard,\u201d he wrote. The \u201cagreement\u201d is currently a \u201cstatement of intent\u201d with both parties saying the finer details are yet to be decided. AAP FactCheck asked Mr Clare if the four per cent provision would be removed. His office did not directly answer and instead pointed to a response Mr Buti gave to a reporter\u2019s question at the January 31 press conference . David Gonski released his review into school funding in 2011. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re talking about this four per cent,\u201d Mr Buti said. \u201cThat has been always considered as part of the funding agreement. Every other state does it. That four per cent goes to ensuring that we have a quality education.\u201d The SRS is an estimate of how much public funding a school needs to meet its students\u2019 educational needs. Each school\u2019s total is made up of a base amount per pupil and then the possible addition of several needs-based loadings, taking into account factors like English language proficiency, socio-educational disadvantage and location. Under the current agreement, the federal government funding for public schools is capped at 20 per cent of the SRS, with states contributing up to 75 per cent, leaving a shortfall of five per cent. Under the new model, WA\u2019s contribution would lift to 77.5 per cent and the federal contribution would rise to 22.5 per cent by the end of 2026. However, under the existing agreement, states can include in their contribution non-SRS costs such as capital depreciation and regulatory fees. This can amount to up to four per cent of the total SRS funding. Experts told AAP FactCheck this means funding only reaches 96 per cent of the SRS level if states take advantage of the full four per cent provision. Nine Newspapers reported last month that the provision meant $2 billion supposedly spent by state and territories in 2023 never reached the classroom. Matthew Sinclair , an educational policy researcher at Curtin University , said the details were still being negotiated ahead of the agreement coming into force next year. He added: \u201cIn summary, unless this clause is removed in the next set of bilateral funding agreements, then the claim that in practice schools can be funded at 96 per cent of the SRS, assuming the states and territories utilise this loophole, rather than 100 per cent, will prove to be correct.\u201d Experts told AAP FactCheck schools may only be 96 per cent funded if provisions remain. Stephen Lamb , an emeritus professor at the Centre for International Research on Education Systems (CIRES), agreed. \u201cIf the previous rules and inclusions are retained this will mean that there is at least four per cent of funding for public schools that is unavailable to be spent on public schools and learning in public schools, relative to private schools,\u201d Professor Lamb said. He said the 100 per cent claim would only be true in a \u201ctechnical sense\u201d and that in reality schools would be 96 per cent funded. The Verdict The claim a new federal and state bilateral agreement will result in Western Australian schools receiving 100 per cent funding under the School Resource Standard (SRS) calculation is unproven. The agreement is currently a statement of intent with details still to be finalised. A current provision allows states to claim four per cent of the total SRS amount as non-SRS costs. If this remains, then it\u2019s possible that schools will only be 96 per cent funded. The federal government has not confirmed if the provision will be removed. Unproven \u2013 There is not enough evidence to determine the claim\u2019s accuracy. AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network .

        "doc": "A meme orbiting on social media claims newspaper photos of the 1969 moon landing could not have been published so quickly, in yet another attempt to suggest the mission was faked. The meme (archived here ) claims that photos of the landing appeared in newspapers on the day Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, something that couldn\u2019t happen because the astronauts needed three days to return to earth and photographs still had to be developed. The claim is false. No one waited three days to see the moon landing because the live television footage was broadcast around the world. The pictures in newspapers \u2013 published the following day \u2013 came from that footage. The Apollo 11 moon landing happened on July 20, 1969. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon , followed by Buzz Aldrin . Millions of people around the world watched the live black-and-white coverage, described as \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest single broadcast\u201d in television history. A Facebook meme falsely claims photos of the moon landing needed three days to get to earth. While NASA would later release high-resolution photos of the moon landing and other Apollo missions, the photos in newspapers the day after the landing were grainy, black-and-white images taken from the broadcast footage. The meme shows a newspaper front page with two moon landing pictures and several stories. Text beneath the front page image on the Facebook post reads: \u201cOn July 21st 1969 Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon where he spoke his legendary words: \u2018one small step for man one giant leap for mankind.\u2019 That same day this picture was in the newspaper. A quick reminder, it was a three day flight back and pictures had to be developed in those days.\u201d The newspaper shown is the front page of The Washington Post from Monday, July 21, 1969 . The headline reads \u201c\u2018The Eagle Has Landed\u2019 \u2014 Two men Walk on the Moon\u201d and all stories on the front are about the mission .The two images can be seen in the original footage that was beamed around the world. The larger image, captioned: \u201cNeil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin plant the American flag on the surface of the moon. The flag is kept \u2018flying\u2019 on the airless moon by a spring device\u201d, can be seen at 66min 17sec. The smaller image, captioned \u201cArmstrong takes his first steps on the moon. At left is the Eagle, the lunar landing craft\u201d, can be seen at 27min 24 sec. Australia played a key role in the moon landing broadcast. Tracking stations at Honeysuckle Creek , Tidbinbilla and Parkes (dramatised in the 2000 movie The Dish ), maintained all communications with Apollo 11 during the moon walk, including the vision of Armstrong\u2019s first step. The CSIRO Parkes Observatory played a key role relaying information from the Apollo 11 moon landing. Conspiracy theories that the moon landing was faked have been debunked repeatedly. This History.com account of some of the conspiracies says about 400,000 scientists, engineers, technologists, machinists and electricians worked on the Apollo program and in more than 50 years, none of them have claimed the program was faked. The Verdict The claim the moon landing was faked \u2013 as images that appeared in the newspapers the same day could not have been transported back to earth and developed in time is false The first images to appear in newspapers were taken from the live footage transmitted back to earth. Photographs taken on the moon returned with the astronauts and were published at a later date. False \u2014 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "\"BREAKING: The US military has carried out MULTIPLE AIRSTRIKES on two locations in eastern Syria,\" says a Facebook post shared on October 27. It features two photos that show huge explosions lighting up the night sky. The US military hit two facilities in eastern Syria on October 26 that it said were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups. Washington said the strike was in response to attacks on US military personnel, who have been targeted more than 40 times with rockets and drones since October 17. The surge in attacks on US troops is linked to the war between Israel and Hamas, which began when the militant group carried out a shock cross-border attack from Gaza on October 7 that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people. Israel's military responded with a relentless air, land and naval assault on Gaza that the territory's health ministry said has left more than 10,500 people dead. A similar post that falsely linked the explosion photos to the US strikes on Syria racked up more than 1.4 million views on X, formerly known as Twitter. The post contains a Community Note -- promoted by the platform's owner Elon Musk as a tool to combat misinformation -- which incorrectly says the photos show US strikes in Syria in March 2023. The Community Note cites an article by British newspaper The Guardian from on March 24 which falsely labels the photos as taken in Syria. Reverse image searches, however, found the photos show separate explosions in Yemen and Gaza in 2018. The first photo was originally published by Reuters news agency on January 31, 2018 (archived link). The photo caption says: \"A Houthi arms depot explodes after it was hit by air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah.\" The Huthis seized Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and control large swathes of the country. A Reuters report about Yemen's civil war contains the same photo. Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in false posts (left) and Reuters' photo (right) with identical features highlighted by AFP: The second photo was taken by an AFP journalist in Gaza on July 20, 2018. The photo caption of the picture, which is available in AFP's archives, says: \"A picture taken on July 20, 2018 shows explosions from Israeli bombardment in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.\" \"Israeli aircraft and tanks hit targets across the Gaza Strip on July 20 after shots were fired at troops on the border, the army said, with Hamas reporting several members of its military wing killed in the latest flare-up in months of tensions. SAID KHATIB / AFP.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in false posts (left) and AFP's photos (right) with identical features highlighted:",

Another Instagram post published on the same day and shared in Africa with a similar caption, reads: \u201cPalestinian fighters shot down 4 Israeli helicopters in Gaza.\u201d Some people who commented believed the footage depicted a genuine event but others wrote that it was a scene from ARMA 3. ARMA 3 is a tactical shooter simulation video game that allows players to experience true combat gameplay (archived here). Scenes from the game are commonly used in misleading claims linked to global conflicts, as shown in these AFP Fact Check debunks here, here and here. Likewise, the purported chopper footage from Israel does not show real military helicopters and is in no way linked to the latest conflict in the region. Using a keyword search, AFP Fact Check found a video published on YouTube on October 3, 2023, days before Hamas militants infiltrated Israel, sparking another bout of violence (archived here). The video\u2019s caption reads: \u201cTwo combat helicopters shot down by anti aircraft defense - Arma (sic)\u201d. It was published on a channel called Kazinkka Warrior, which features gameplay videos \u201ccreated in the Arma 3 game editor\u201d (archived here). None of the videos \u201cposition themselves as a demonstration of real military operations\u201d, the channel adds in its description section. The video circulating on Instagram has been slightly cropped, but the similarities between the two versions are clear to see: a line of text that invites users to \u201cSubscribe for More\u201d, the helicopter flares, the ridgeline in the background, and the trees and bushes. War broke out on October 7, 2023, following a surprise dawn attack launched from the Gaza Strip by Hamas militants who stormed Israel under a barrage of rocket fire. As reported by AFP on October 11, 2023, more than 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side while the death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to at least 900. Despite extensive keyword searches, there have been no reports of Israeli combat helicopters shot down over Gaza during the latest conflict. Arabic posts with the same video and similar claims were also debunked by AFP Fact Check.",

A security guard's daughter has hoisted the Indian flag at the Asian Games,\" reads a Hindi-language Facebook post from September 26. \"Jyothi Yarraji received many congratulations and best wishes for winning the gold medal in the 100 metres hurdles. #AsianGames.\" The video, which has more than 15,000 views, shows a women's 100-metre hurdles race in which the Indian sprinter takes first place. The clip was shared in similar Facebook posts here and here. It also surfaced on X, formerly Twitter, alongside the same falsehood. Comments left under these posts suggest some Indians believed the claim that the video was recorded at the Asian Games. \"India's glory continues in Asian Games, India's daughter wins gold,\" reads one comment. Another says: \"Andhra Pradesh's daughter Jyothi Yarraji wins gold in the Asian Games, a proud moment for the country,\" referring to a southern state in India. While the video does show Jyothi winning her race, the event took place at the Asian Athletics Championships in Thailand in July, not the Asian Games in China. The logo of the Asian Athletics Championships can clearly be seen in the background as the sprinters pull away from the starting blocks four seconds into the video. It also flashes across the screen as a graphic at the 57-second mark. The name of the athletics meeting is displayed on the shirts of competitors at various points in the two-minute and 20-second clip. A keyword search on Google found the same video was uploaded to X by the Sports Authority of India on July 13, 2023 (archived link). The caption on this post reads: \u201c@JyothiYarraji bags the 1st (gold medal) for (India) at the ongoing Asian Athletics Championships 2023. The #TOPSchemeAthlete clocked a time of 13.09s in the Women's 100m Hurdles Event.\" Below are screenshot comparisons between the video in the false Facebook post (left) and the video from the Sports Authority of India (right): The result of the race can be found listed here on the official website of the Asian Athletics Championships (archived link). News of Jyothi's win was also widely shared by Indian media in July, including here and here (archived links here and here). The Asian Games meanwhile kicked off on September 23 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou and finished on October 8. Jyothi took home silver on October 1 after almost being disqualified over an alleged false start. In a dramatic race, she and Chinese hurdler Wu Yanni were both called for false starts but were allowed to compete after Jyothi protested (archived link). Wu crossed the line ahead of Jyothi but in a review the false start decision against Wu was upheld, meaning the Chinese athlete was disqualified. Jyothi's medal was consequently upgraded from bronze to silver. Lin Yuwei of China took gold. The results can be found here on the official web page of the 19th Asian Games (archived link).",

        "doc": "\u201cOn December 12, 2022 In Senegal, West Africa, a mob attacked a United Nations, vehicle early and discovered it carried kidnapped children for human trafficking and organ harvesting purposes before they freed them (sic),\u201d reads a post published on X (formerly Twitter) on September 27, 2023. Reposted more than 13,000 times, the post features a two-minute clip showing an irate mob attacking a white vehicle. In the video, the crowd is seen forcing the door of the vehicle open to reveal children inside. Several other accounts on Facebook shared the same claim, including here. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in a 2021 report that three out of four people trafficked in West Africa - where Senegal is located - were children (archived here). \u201cOut of 4,799 victims detected in 26 Sub-Saharan African countries, 3,336 were in West Africa including 2,553 children,\u201d the report noted. Many of the victims were trafficked within their countries, it said. However, the claim that the video shows a UN vehicle used for child trafficking is false. Two seconds into the video, the word \u201cSincere Security\u201d can be seen written on the van. At the seven-second mark, an address \u2014 33 Airdrie Road Eastlea \u2014 and telephone number can also be seen on the side of the van. A keyword search for \u201cSincere Security Airdrie Road Eastlea\u201d led to the contact page on the website of a private security company. One of the telephone numbers listed on the company\u2019s website also matches the number on the van. Sincere Security Services says on its website that it was established in 2006 and that it is \u201ca wholly Zimbabwean-owned entity\u201d (archived here). Another keyword search, this time for \u201cSincere Security kidnapped children\u201d, led to a version of the video published by Zimbabwean news outlet ZimEye on April 19, 2019 (archived here). The caption explained that the van in the video belonged to Sincere Security Services. The outlet said in its report that the driver of the vehicle was driving his employer\u2019s four children in Bulawayo, a city in southwest Zimbabwe when he was mistaken for a kidnapper (archived here). Another local news report published the previous day said that the driver, described as a \u201csecurity guard\u201d, was taking the children to their parents (archived here). A spokesperson for the UN office in Senegal, Cheikh Sakho, told AFP Fact Check that the claim that a UN vehicle was used for trafficking children was \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cNone of our agencies use this type of vehicle\u201d seen in the video, said Sakho.",

        "doc": "\"There have been two cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection in Rayong. Both died from eating undercooked and raw cockles, mussels and seafood,\" reads a Thai-language post on Facebook from September 13. Rayong is a coastal province in eastern Thailand and a popular destination for tourists in search of fresh ocean produce. The Facebook post contains a picture of a person's torso with the skin discoloured. The text claims two people were infected by Vibrio vulnificus, a type of bacteria found naturally in marine waters. Vibrio vulnificus infects people via an open wound while swimming or transmits through consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (archived link). In severe cases the flesh around an open wound dies, which has led some media to label Vibrio vulnificus the \"flesh-eating bacteria\". \"One patient died at Rayong Hospital while another died at Klaeng Hospital,\" the post claims. It has been shared more than 100 times. Warning Show Hide The post surfaced after the CDC issued an alert on September 1 following the deaths of at least a dozen people from Vibrio vulnificus in the United States in 2023 (archived links here and here). Similar false posts have been shared elsewhere on Facebook here, here and here, prompting Thai social media users to leave comments saying they would stop eating seafood. \"No more eating cockles and mussels for life,\" wrote one. \"I'll stop eating seafood for a long while,\" another said. Thai authorities told AFP the claim about two people dying from Vibrio vulnificus is false and the photo actually shows a man stung by a jellyfish in 2020. Rayong's public health authority dismissed the claim in a September 13 post on its Facebook page, calling it \"fake news\" (archived link). \"The photo is not related to the CDC's news about flesh-eating bacteria,\" its statement said. A similar statement was issued by the government's National News Bureau of Thailand on the same day (archived link). A Rayong health official told AFP on September 14 that \"there have been no reports of deaths linked to eating undercooked seafood this year\". \"Currently, Rayong province has not seen any patient who died from Vibrio vulnificus as claimed,\" Dr Sunthorn Rheanpumikankit said. Moreover, AFP found the image actually shows a Thai fisherman who was stung by a jellyfish in Rayong three years ago. A keyword search on Google revealed that a photo of his discoloured torso taken from a slightly different angle was published in July 2020 by local media. News reports here and here say the 49-year-old was out diving for fish when he was stung and later died from his wounds (archived links here and here). He was pronounced dead at a hospital in Rayong, according to a statement from the Klaeng Hospital on September 26, 2023 issued in response to an enquiry from AFP. The hospital said the photo in the Facebook posts shows the jellyfish victim. \"The male patient, aged 49, came into contact with a jellyfish. He was admitted to Klaeng Hospital on July 23, 2020, before being referred to Rayong Hospital on the same day,\" reads the statement. \"Following the treatment, the patient died at Rayong Hospital on July 24, 2020.\" Below is a screenshot comparison between the false post on Facebook (left) and a photo of the man's torso published by local media (right): Warning Show Hide",

        "doc": "\"Here are the six little sons that a mother from Ragama gave birth to. The hospital director says they are all in good health,\" reads a Sinhala-language Facebook post from October 17, referring to a suburb of Colombo. It is accompanied by a picture of six babies swaddled in hospital beds. The post has since been shared more than 800 times. The post began circulating just hours after news broke on October 17 that a mother from Ragama had given birth to sextuplets at a hospital in the Sri Lankan capital (archived link). According to local media outlet Ada Derana, doctors said the boys were born prematurely, at 26 weeks, and were receiving medical attention (archived link). Other reports said the mother and babies were in good health (archived link). Identical claims that the photo showed the sextuplets soon spread across Facebook, including in posts here and here. However, the picture shows infants at a hospital nursery in Danbury, Connecticut, and was captured in 1995 by late American photographer Blaine Harrington III. A reverse image search on Google led to a 2016 article on Pixsy, an online platform helping photographers tackle misuse of their work (archived link). The article features Harrington discussing the pros and cons of working as a stock photographer and features the picture of the six babies along with Harrington's watermark. \"Newborn babies in hospital nursery, Danbury, Connecticut, USA. My daughter was just born (she is the baby in the second row, far left),\" a caption from Harrington reads. \"This image is still selling today and, in fact, has been sold somewhere in the world almost every month, for 21 years,\" it adds. Harrington says in the article that he obtained permission from the parents of each baby before taking the picture. Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the false posts (left) and the image in the Pixsy article (right): The same photo has also been published in other articles online with credit to Harrington, including here and here (archived links here and here). Harrington died in January, his team told AFP. A spokesperson for the photographer confirmed the picture is his work and said it was captured in 1995 when his daughter was born. According to The Woman\u2019s Hospital of Texas in the United States, where a mother gave birth to sextuplets in 2019, the odds of doing so are estimated to be about one in 4.7 billion.",

        "doc": "\"Israel PM Netanyahu sends his son to serve the country as a soldier,\" says an October 11, 2023 post sharing the image on X, formerly known as Twitter, which has been littered with misinformation about the conflict. Similar posts spread in several languages across X and other platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, after Hamas fighters carried out an unprecedented surprise attack October 7 -- the deadliest since Israel's founding 75 years ago. Hundreds of Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip rushed across the border, gunning down civilians under a barrage of rockets and taking about 150 hostages, including Americans and other foreigners. In retaliation, Israel has pounded Gaza -- the densely populated, impoverished territory governed by Hamas and under a blockade for years -- with air strikes, leveling entire neighborhoods and sending residents fleeing for safety. Israel also cut off water, electricity and food and deployed soldiers around the Palestinian enclave and on its northern border with Lebanon. The country called up some 300,000 reservists for the war -- an order that activates some former service members. But the photo of Netanyahu reaching for his son Avner's face is nearly nine years old -- and any plans for the prime minister's sons to join the fight had not been released as of 1900 GMT on October 12. A reverse image search reveals the shot was published by the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and other media outlets on December 1, 2014 (archived here and here). The picture shows the younger Netanyahu reporting for military duty with the Israeli Defense Forces, as is required for all citizens 18 and older, with some exceptions. He joined a combat unit engaged in field intelligence, according to the reports. The prime minister published the photo on his Facebook page that day, crediting it to Kobi Gideon of the state's Government Press Office (archived here). He posted the picture again three years later when Avner completed his service (archived here). Avner Netanyahu's departure and family farewells were also captured on video (archived here). AFP has debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict here.",

        "doc": "\"Israeli cruelly burns Al-Aqsa Mosque,\" reads Indonesian-language text superimposed on a TikTok video posted on October 25, 2023. \"No wonder it rained for a while on Tuesday night, October 24, 2023 in Bekasi,\" the text continues, referring to a city in Indonesia's West Java province. \"The sky mourns.\" The mosque in Jerusalem's Old City is the third-holiest site in Islam and is known as the Temple Mount to Jews, who revere it as their most sacred site. Al-Aqsa has been a site of frequent clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians. In April, more than 350 people were arrested after clashes erupted inside the mosque. The one-minute video, which has been viewed more than 369,000 times, shows a crowd in front of a large fire. A man filming himself in the video repeatedly shouts \"God is the greatest\" in Arabic as four loud bangs are heard in the background. \"They burned Al-Aqsa Mosque... they want to burn Al-Aqsa Mosque,\" he also says. The video circulated after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering a war that has killed thousands of civilians on both sides. The attack, the deadliest in Israel's history, saw gunmen storm across the border from Gaza, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and taking at least 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel retaliated with a relentless aerial bombardment that killed more than 10,800 people, many of them children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry on November 7, 2023. The same video was shared on TikTok here, here, here and here, racking up more than 234,000 views in total. It also appeared on Facebook here in a post from 2021 that claimed Al-Aqsa Mosque had been set on fire. But reverse image and keyword searches show similar photos and videos circulated in reports of a tree catching fire during clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians at the mosque in 2021. As of November 10, 2023, there have been no reports of Israel attacking the mosque since the outbreak of war. A closer analysis of the video shared in the false posts found it in fact showed a tree on fire, rather than the mosque. Keyword searches on Google led to a similar video published by video-licensing agency Storyful on May 11, 2021 (archived link). The footage, which is more than 22 minutes long, shows a flaming tree with people running around a compound, while four loud bangs are also heard in the background. \"A tree caught fire near Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem on Monday, May 10, as violent exchanges between worshippers and Israel Police left hundreds injured,\" the report that accompanies the video reads. \"This footage was captured by the Palestinian network AlQastal on Monday night. According to reports, the fire was quickly put out and did not cause damage to the mosque.\" In the Storyful clip, firefighters can also be seen putting out the blaze and the golden dome of Al-Aqsa Mosque is visible far in the background, untouched by the fire. AFP reported that a huge fire engulfed trees in the compound housing the mosque on May 10, 2021, following nights of clashes between Israeli riot police and Palestinian worshippers. The clashes had started a few days earlier, on May 7, the last Friday of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan. There is no mention of Al-Aqsa Mosque itself being set on fire. Further keyword searches and reverse image searches on Google led to similar photos of the tree on fire, posted by Suleiman Maswadeh, political correspondent of Israeli state-owned broadcaster Kan, here on X, formerly Twitter, on May 11, 2021 (archived link). A report by Reuters news agency about the tree blaze said there was no damage to the mosque (archived link). It said witnesses \"offered contradicting accounts of whether the flames were caused by Palestinians who had thrown fireworks at police or by a police stun grenade\". Below is a screenshot comparison of the genuine video from Storyful (left), the video in the false post (centre), and a photo from Maswadeh (right), with similarities marked by AFP: A panorama created by stitching together stills from the falsely shared video corresponds to images of Al-Aqsa Mosque's compound seen on Google Street View (archived link). Below is a comparison of the panorama created from frames of the falsely shared video (left) and the same location as seen on Google Street View (right): AFP has debunked a wave of misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war here.",

        "doc": "\"#Israel In response to the attack in Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces began bombing Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip,\" says a Thai-language Facebook post shared on October 7. The video, which has more than 32,000 views, shows a tower block crumble to the ground after it is hit by airstrikes. The logo of international news outlet Al Jazeera features in the top-left corner of the video. More than one million people have fled their homes in Gaza as Israel bombarded the territory and continued massing troops in preparation for a full-blown ground invasion. The bombing -- which has killed at least 2,670 people, mainly civilians -- was in retaliation for a bloody attack in which waves of Hamas fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on October 7, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Hamas also took about 150 Israeli, foreign and dual national hostages back to Gaza in the initial attack, Israel has said. Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, shared the footage here, here and here, falsely linking it to the fresh violence in Gaza. One Thai-language TikTok post expressed solidarity with Thai nationals in the territory, after Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said on October 14 that 24 Thais had been killed and 16 taken hostage (archived link). A keyword search and Google reverse image search found the video uploaded to Al Jazeera's YouTube channel on May 14, 2021 (archived link). \"Israel destroys third Gaza tower | AJ #shorts,\" the video's caption reads. The video's description adds: \"This is the moment the 14-storey al-Shorouq tower, housing media offices in Gaza City, was completely destroyed by multiple Israeli air raids on Wednesday [May 12, 2021].\" Al Jazeera reported that the Al-Shorouk building, which was built in 1995, was one of the most famous landmarks in Gaza (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison between the misleading Facebook post (left) and Al Jazeera's video uploaded on YouTube (right): Reuters photographer Ibraheem Abu Mustafa took a string of photos of the blast, which ressemble Al Jazeera' video (archived link).",

        "doc": "One Facebook post, which has been shared more than 27,000 times, warns people to be ready to evacuate. \"Possible it will develop into a typhoon or super typhoon during landfall on Saturday,\" says the post, which was published on November 14. \"Prepare yourself, LPA (low pressure area) will enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Thursday, November 16, and is predicted by PAGASA to reach 185km in sustained winds,\" it adds. PAGASA is the national weather agency and the Philippine Area of Responsibility is the region it monitors. The post was written in a mix of English and Visayan, which is spoken in the central Philippines. It claims the eye of the storm was forecast to pass over the central provinces of Cebu and Leyte. Similar warnings were shared elsewhere on Facebook including here, here and here. Social media users appeared to believe the claim. \"Thank you for the update. God, protect us,\" one said. \"God, help your children here on Earth, don't let us die,\" wrote another. The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 major storms a year and scientists have warned that typhoons are becoming stronger due to human-induced climate change. But weather agencies in the Philippines and overseas did not issue any warning about a super typhoon near the country in mid-November. PAGASA told AFP it did not issue any alert for a super typhoon in the period. The US government's Climate Prediction Center also did not track any super typhoon around the Philippines during the week beginning November 13 (archived link). The centre regularly publishes a global forecast of weather hazards in the tropics. The Hong Kong Observatory did not mention any super typhoon either. Keyword searches on both its Chinese and English accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, found no related warning (archived links here and here). \"As of our latest official advisory, there is no announcement or prediction from PAGASA about a super typhoon entering the [Philippine Area of Responsibility] on November 18,\" said PAGASA weather services chief Jun Galang on November 16. The Philippine bureau did issue an advisory about a \"tropical depression\" located near the Pacific nation of Palau, warning it could develop into a typhoon and hit the central Philippines. But there was no mention of a super typhoon. Palau lies almost 1,000 kilometres east of the Philippines. PAGASA issued three advisories about this weather system. The first on the morning of November 13 identified the tropical depression -- the first tier in a five-tier cyclone classification system based on wind strength (archived links here and here). \"This tropical cyclone may intensify over the TCA (Tropical Cyclone Advisory) region and reach typhoon category with peak intensity of 120km/h on Saturday. The possibility of further intensification prior to its close approach to Eastern Visayas is not ruled out,\" it said, referring to the central Philippines. However, there was no mention of a super typhoon, and on November 14 PAGASA issued a final advisory saying the tropical depression had weakened to a low pressure area (archived link). A super typhoon is classified in the Philippines as a storm with maximum wind speeds exceeding 185kph. PAGASA weather specialist Daniel James Villamil said in a forecast four days later that \"there is little chance it will develop into a storm in the coming days\" (archived link). No typhoon has hit the Philippine archipelago so far this November. The satellite image with the Facebook post shows Super Typhoon Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, hurtling towards the country in November 2013, another PAGASA specialist, Marco Iba\u00f1ez, told AFP. \"The screenshot of the Facebook post you sent is truly misleading,\" he said on November 16. \"That is a satellite image of Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda.\" A reverse image search on Google found an identical photo posted to Wikipedia (archived link). \"Typhoon Haiyan at peak intensity and approaching the Philippines on November 7, 2013,\" reads a caption with the image. It is credited to US space agency NASA. The same photo was also identified as Haiyan by the World History Archive, which is based in Britain (archived link). Below is a screenshot of the image in the Facebook post (left) alongside the photo on Wikipedia (right): Haiyan unleashed winds of up to 315 kilometres an hour (195 miles per hour) that flattened towns and cities across a 600-kilometre stretch of central islands in the Philippines. About 6,300 people were killed and a decade later more than a thousand are still classed as missing. AFP has previously debunked another weather warning regarding the Philippines.",

        "doc": "\"In this video taken today in Jenin, a medic from 'Doctors without borders' went to a terrorist who the IDF shot, lifted him up and took his weapon then brought it to another terrorist,\" says Nataly Dadon, an Israeli model, in the caption of a November 9, 2023 Instagram post. \"Basically he abused his position as a medic, which the IDF cannot shoot, to break the law and assist terrorists to get a weapon.\" Other versions of the same video circulated on Facebook, Reddit and X, formerly known as Twitter. Some posts claim the man is dressed as a \"Red Crescent medic.\" Violence has flared in the West Bank since Hamas militants poured into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, killing 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and taking some 240 hostages, according to the country's latest figures. Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and unleashed an aerial bombing campaign and ground invasion of Gaza that the Hamas government says has killed nearly 15,000 people, also mostly civilians. As of November 27, a temporary truce is in place in Gaza. AFP could not independently verify the identity of the person handling the weapon, but Doctors Without Borders, known in French as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), said he is not a member of their group. \"The person depicted in the video is clearly not wearing an MSF logo or any other identification related to MSF,\" a spokesperson said in a November 27 email. \"MSF staff do not wear orange vests seen in the video. Our staff around the world are required to wear MSF identification (T-shirt, gear) because it is one of the main protections that we have: our medical identity and credibility.\" The spokesperson warned the video could incite violence, calling it \"a severe threat not only against MSF staff but all humanitarian workers in the region.\" Doctors Without Borders has been working in the West Bank throughout the conflict -- including the city of Jenin, where Palestinians have clashed with Israeli soldiers. But the humanitarian group's teams are clearly identified by their white vests. At around 2am, on 27 October, our medical team arrived at Jenin hospital following an Israeli forces incursion in Jenin refugee camp. Two Palestinians were reportedly killed, and many more were injured. Our staff in collaboration with MoH staff treated the severely wounded. pic.twitter.com/rmB0UisQjV Claims that the vest in the video bears the logo of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the world's largest humanitarian network, are also inaccurate. \"The person in the video is not a Palestine Red Crescent member. Their vest is completely different and they are not at all linked to this video/event,\" an IFRC spokesperson said in an email November 27. In the footage, the person who picks up the weapon wears an orange vest with black and white stripes at the waist. The yellow logo and lettering on the back appear to match that of the Palestinian Medical Relief Society (PMRS), which operates in the West Bank and Gaza. AFP reached out to PMRS for comment, but no response was forthcoming. Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and its troops regularly launch raids across the Palestinian territory.

In the 15-second video, a group of women, all dressed in similar pink saris, can be seen being held back by other policemen. The post's Hindi-language caption reads, \"Shivraj Singh Chouhan's police congratulated beloved sisters on the passing of 'Women's Reservation Bill' in Madhya Pradesh. Atrocities on sisters continue, in Chouhan's government.\" The post was uploaded days after the Women's Reservation Bill -- which would reserve a third of seats in India's national and state legislatures for women -- was passed by the lower house of the parliament on September 20, 2023, and the upper house the following day. The measure has been hailed as an important step toward gender equality in the South Asian country, where women are underrepresented in public life. Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of India's Madhya Pradesh state, is a politican from the country's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which sponsored the bill (archived link). Chouhan is set to contest in Madhya Pradesh's state elections, which are scheduled to be held by the end of 2023 (archived link). The video also circulated in similar posts on Facebook here and here -- where it garnered more than 1,100 views -- as well as on X, formerly known as Twitter, here. However, the claim is false. The video actually shows an incident in India's eastern state of Jharkhand in September 2019, years before the Women's Reservation Bill was passed by parliament. A combination of reverse image and keyword searches on Google found a longer version of the video was published in a report by Indian news outlet The Quint on September 25, 2019 (archived link). The report is titled, \"Women Anganwadi Workers Beaten Up by Policemen in Jharkhand.\" Anganwadi refers to India's rural child care centres, run by modestly paid workers (archived link). According to The Quint's report, several protesting workers, who belong to the union Anganwadi Sevika Sahayaka Sangh, were brutally beaten up by policemen in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand, on September 24, 2019 (archived link). The workers were rallying to make various demands, including social security benefits and an increase in retirement age. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the false post (left) and the original video from The Quint (right): The video of the beating was also published on a workers' media outlet on September 25, 2019 (archived link). Images from the protest, which correspond to footage of the protest, were published by local news sites here and here (archived links here and here). AFP also geolocated the street where the incident took place. The wall murals seen in the video match with those on the Google Street View imagery of a street in Ranchi (archived link).

        "doc": "\"American soldiers praying for their country, for Israel before being deployed to defend Israel. If you believe God answered their prayers say amen,\" says a November 3, 2023 Facebook post sharing the photo. The image racked up thousands of engagements and also spread to X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Israel said November 8, 2023 it was tightening the \"stranglehold\" around Hamas, whose fighters launched an unprecedented attack one month earlier that according to Israeli officials killed 1,400 people, including mainly civilians. Israel's relentless air strikes targeting Hamas have killed more than 10,500 people, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there will be no ceasefire or fuel delivered to Gaza unless the more than 240 hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group are freed. A key ally of Israel, the United States has rushed military equipment to the country while also bolstering its forces in the region and supporting hostage rescue efforts. American forces in Iraq and Syria have also been attacked dozens of times with rockets and drones since mid-October, a spike Washington has blamed on Iran-backed forces that could risk drawing the United States into a broader conflict. But the picture of praying American troops is unrelated to the war -- it predates the recent fighting by at least six years. Reverse image searches indicate the shot has circulated since at least October 2017, with the earliest posts on Facebook and X saying it shows a chapel service at Fort Benning, a US Army military base in the state of Georgia now known as Fort Moore (archived here and here). AFP could not independently verify the location or origin of the photo, which was previously misrepresented after Russian invaded Ukraine. Fort Moore said it could not confirm the picture's validity. US officials have said since the war declaration October 8 that it will aid Israel, but without American forces in combat on the ground. A senior Pentagon official told a briefing October 12: \"We have no intention of putting US forces on the ground at this time, but we are providing advice, and we will continue to consult with our Israeli partners about their security assistance needs.\" AFP has previously debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war here.",

        "doc": "\"Suspected ANTIFA trying to break windows at the Capitol on #january6th,\" says a November 29, 2023 post on X, formerly known as Twitter, from a self-described \"January 6 survivor.\" The roughly one-minute video shows two men dressed in black repeatedly hitting a Capitol window, one with a flag and the other with what appears to be a baton. Former Republican congressional candidate Chuck Callesto, who has previously spread other disinformation about the Capitol riot, amplified the clip. The claims add to a deluge of posts recycling long-debunked conspiracy theories about undercover federal agents and left-wing activists infiltrating the mob of Donald Trump supporters on January 6, 2021. The allegations resurged across platforms after new Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered hours of security footage released in November. But the latest video does not show members of Antifa, a loose coalition of anti-fascist activists that US conservatives commonly blame for unrest, and who typically wear head-to-toe black clothing. Court documents have identified the men as Jonathan Munafo of Albany, New York and William Lewis of Burbank, Illinois. The former pleaded guilty to two felony charges and was sentenced in September, while the latter was arrested in November for assaulting a law enforcement officer and other charges (archived here and here). The two are among more than 1,200 people who have been arrested in connection with the violent attempt to halt Congress's certification of President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory. Former president Trump himself is slated to go on trial in March on charges of conspiring to overturn those results. Keven Ruby, a senior research associate with the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, told AFP his team has found no evidence of Antifa involvement -- echoing statements the FBI made shortly after the riot. \"We currently have data on over 1,100 individuals charged by the FBI, DC Police or US Capitol Police for their role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. None have ties to Antifa,\" Ruby said in a December 1 email, adding that court documents show several rioters have personally refuted claims that Antifa was involved. The man on the right in the video shared online -- seen brandishing a flag reading \"Don't Tread on Me\" -- is Munafo, identified in court documents by the black hooded jacket pulled over his hat. A judge sentenced Munafo in September to 33 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release (archived here). He had pleaded guilty to felony charges of civil disorder and assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers (archived here). While outside the Capitol, Munafo punched a police officer twice before stealing his riot shield, according to court documents (archived here and here). He later struck the building's window approximately 13 times with the flagpole. The court's sentencing memorandum from September shows a screenshot from what appears to be the same footage being misrepresented. Prosecutors said another rioter recorded and uploaded it to YouTube (archived here and here). \"As it begins, Munafo is smashing on the windows of the Capitol. He continues until another rioter comes and stops him,\" prosecutors said of the video. Far from being a member of Antifa, Munafo was an ardent Trump supporter, his attorneys wrote in a court filing (archived here). \"During the 2020 election season, Jonathan was a 'Front Row Joe,' camping at rally locations, waiting in lines to show support for President Donald J. Trump's reelection,\" they said. At the time he went to Washington, Munafo was not taking mental health medication and lacked stable housing, employment and income, his attorneys said. The man to Munafo's left in the video is Lewis, identifiable by his backpack and black jacket with sleeves bearing a US Army logo and an American flag. Lewis was arrested in November on felony charges of civil disorder and assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as several misdemeanors, including destruction of government property. Court documents allege Lewis blasted officers with a wasp and hornet spray three times before throwing the empty canister at them and moving to the window, where he used what resembled a police baton to break at least three glass panels (archived here). The case against Lewis had not been resolved as of December 1. Other clips on X and YouTube appear to show different angles of Munafo and Lewis striking the Capitol window. News outlets have published similar footage (archived here, here, here and here). AFP has debunked other misinformation about the Capitol attack here.",

        "doc": "\"That's one way to celebrate Black Friday,\" says a November 26, 2023 post sharing the clip on X, formerly known as Twitter. The post comes from Ian Miles Cheong, a far-right commentator who has previously spread other misinformation, including mispresented looting videos. Similar posts spread across X and other platforms -- including Facebook, TikTok and Rumble -- in the days after the November 24 retail event, which customarily takes place after Thanksgiving and attracts large crowds of bargain-hunting shoppers. The annual frenzy for discounts has seen brawls and other violence break out over the years. But the clip circulating online is several years old and unrelated to \"Black Friday.\" Chicago Sun-Times journalist Ben Pope, who covers the Chicago Blackhawks professional hockey franchise, first posted the footage to X on May 30, 2020, reverse image searches show. He geotagged the video to Chicago and said it showed a \"Nike store on Michigan Ave smashed and completely looted\" (archived here). Nike store on Michigan Ave smashed and completely looted pic.twitter.com/IRZc4FuDBO \"I personally took that video back in 2020,\" Pope told AFP in a November 27, 2023 email. The store is part of a popular Chicago shopping district known as \"The Magnificent Mile.\" Google Maps Street View imagery shows a storefront and surrounding buildings that match those in the video (archived here). Photos published in local news reports depict the same shattered window glass and dismantled plywood seen in Pope's footage (archived here and here). The reports say the looting took place as protesters marched in downtown Chicago on May 30, 2020 to decry the killing of Floyd, a Black man whose death at the hands of a white police officer in the state of Minnesota sparked similar demonstrations nationwide. AFP has debunked other posts misrepresenting footage from the 2020 unrest here, here, here and here.",

        "doc": "\"Video of the convoy of aid vehicles piling up in front of the Rafah border. Gaza people need this aid, but the ruthless Zionist regime has blocked all routes for any aid that goes to Palestinians,\" reads an Indonesian-language post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on October 14, 2023. The aerial footage, which is nearly two minutes long, shows long lines of vehicles in the middle of a desert, parked in front of a wall with the Egyptian flag raised above it. The video has been viewed more than 4.6 million times in total after it was shared alongside a similar claim in posts on Facebook, SnackVideo and TikTok here and here. Similar posts have also circulated in other languages, including Polish, English, French and Spanish. Hamas gunmen carried out on October 7 a cross-border attack, the worst in Israel's history, that left around 1,200 people dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli government. In retaliation, Israel launched a major bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, which, according to the Hamas government in the territory on November 21, has killed 14,100 people, thousands of them children. Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory is under siege, with minimal food, water and fuel allowed in. At the time the video surfaced online, international aid had piled up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, the only route into Gaza after all Israeli checkpoints were closed following the shock Hamas assault. Images taken by an AFP journalist on October 16, for example here and here, show a convoy of trucks carrying aid supplies for Gaza from Egypt waiting on the main Ismailia desert road, about 300 kilometres (185 miles) east of the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip, on the way to the Rafah crossing. The video shared in the posts, however, predates the Israel-Hamas war. A Google reverse image search found an image showing a similar scene in a report about goods entering the Gaza Strip from Egypt published by Israeli media N12 News on June 28, 2021 (archived link). The footage includes a watermark for Egyptian television channel Al Nahar TV (archived link). Further searches using the tool \"Who Posted What\" -- which allows users to carry out keyword searches for Facebook posts from a particular date -- for posts by Al Nahar TV in 2021 found the original footage uploaded to the broadcaster's official Facebook page on May 31, 2021 (archived links here and here). The Arabic-caption of the post says: \"Egypt sends the largest convoys of support and aid to the Palestinians in Gaza for the third time.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the video from the false post (left) and the video from Al Nahar TV (right): Egypt had sent ambulances and aid to Gaza after a series of rocket attacks on the area in May 2021, which was triggered by an Israeli security force crackdown on protests against the explusion of Palestinians from their homes to make way for Jewish settlers in an annexed east Jerusalem neighbourhood, AFP reported at the time. More than 200 Palestinians were killed in the conflict, which lasted nearly two weeks, with the United Nations saying that more than half of the dead were civilians. A similar video showing Egypt's aid convoy to Gaza was also published to the official YouTube channel of Egyptian media outlet Sada El Balad on May 31, 2021 (archived link). The war between Israel and Hamas has triggered a deluge of misinformation, debunked by AFP here.",

        "doc": "\"This is a good way to start a riot. Spray pepper spray into the face of a peaceful protester on J6. What a complete setup,\" says actress Pamela Hensley, who has previously shared misinformation about US President Joe Biden and other Democratic politicians, in a November 27, 2023 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Another post from an account called \"ProudArmyBrat,\" which has also previously amplified misinformation, adds: \"If this wasn't meant to instigate the crowd, nothing was!\" The image spread across X and other platforms, adding to a flood of posts rehashing long-debunked conspiracy theories about the riot being an FBI setup. The claims resurged after new Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered hours of security footage released in November. More than 1,200 people have been arrested in connection to the attack, during which Trump supporters sought to halt Congress's certification of Biden's 2020 electoral victory. Trump, who is slated to go on trial in March on charges of conspiring to overturn those results, has amplified calls to prosecute the police officers who defended the Capitol. But the picture circulating online is manipulated. In the original photo taken by AFP photographer Roberto Schmidt (archived here), the officer is not smiling or wearing glasses. He also has a smaller nose. The officer and the man blasted with the spray -- who wore a blue shirt, glasses and a red beanie with what looks like a pro-Trump logo on the side -- appear in other photos Schmidt snapped during the riot. Other outlets also captured photos of both individuals (archived here and here). AFP could not determine the identity of the rioter -- or whether he has been charged or arrested. AFP contacted Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for comment, but no response was forthcoming. Keven Ruby, a senior research associate with the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, previously told AFP that his team's analysis of more than 1,130 cases related to the Capitol attack has found no evidence FBI agents instigated any defendant charged. FBI Director Christopher Wray has also testified that his agency had \"emphatically not\" orchestrated the violence. AFP has debunked other misinformation about the January 6, 2021 attack here.",

The post features a screenshot of a document saying the banknote is being banned in order to curb illicit activities, with the header \"Government of Pakistan, Finance Division (Internal Finance Wing)\" and the government logo. Similar posts have also been shared on Facebook here, here and here, and on X here and here. However, the document is fabricated and the claim is false. Pakistan's caretaker minister for information Murtaza Solangi said in a post on X on September 7 the document claiming the ban on the 5,000-rupee note is \"fake\" (archived link) \"A fake notification is being circulated on social media regarding ban on 5,000 rupees currency note from September 30, 2023,\" Solangi said. \"The Govt of Pakistan shall act against the people spreading this kind of fake news to create chaos.\" The finance minister also said in a statement on September 7 that \"no policy decision or measure has been taken for banning the 5,000 rupees note,\" according to state media Associated Press of Pakistan (archived link). The website of the State Bank of Pakistan, the country's central bank, lists the 5,000-rupee banknote as valid currency as of November 20 here (archived link). The 5,000-rupee note remains in circulation and is accepted by banks and businesses across Pakistan, an AFP journalist in the country confirmed. Below is a screenshot of a slip for the 5,000-rupee note deposited by the AFP journalist and validated by a bank in Islamabad on November 16: The claim has actually been circulating online in Pakistan for years, especially since the Senate passed a non-binding resolution recommending the government to scrap the 5,000-rupee note in 2016. The recommendation was made to \"curb the flow of black money\" two months after neighbouring India discontinued 1,000 and 500-rupee notes, local paper Dawn reported. But it was rejected by the government, according to a report from Reuters. The government already debunked the claim in 2018 and 2019, according to local media.",

        "doc": "\"Bella Hadid stands with Israel,\" says an October 28, 2023 post on X, formerly known as Twitter, sharing the video with Hebrew captions. In the clip, the supermodel -- whose father is Palestinian -- appears to say: \"On October 7, 2023, Israel faced a tragic attack by Hamas. I can't stay silent. I apologize for my past remarks. This tragedy has opened my eyes to the pain endured here and I stand with Israel against terror.\" Similar posts spread across Facebook, TikTok and YouTube -- some with #WeFixedItForBella. The posts come as Israeli forces continue to bombard the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack. Fighters associated with the Palestinian Islamist movement killed more than 1,400 people -- mainly civilians -- and took some 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said more than 9,200 people, mostly women and children, had been killed in air strikes as of November 3. Some 16 hospitals across Gaza are no longer functioning because of damage from strikes and the lack of fuel, the ministry said. The conflict has sparked protests around the world -- as well as a torrent of misinformation online, including altered images of celebrities appearing to show support for one side or the other. The video of Hadid is the latest example of that trend. Hadid has been a vocal proponent of Palestinian rights for years, making several public statements about the issue and facing backlash for her advocacy. After initial silence on the war, she shared a statement in an October 26, 2023 Instagram post saying: \"My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood\" (archived here). A post shared by Bella (@bellahadid) The video of her purportedly rebuking these statements is inauthentic. A reverse image search indicates the clip was altered from a speech Hadid gave in 2016 at the Global Lyme Alliance gala in New York (archived here). Hadid, who has suffered from Lyme disease, spoke about her experience battling the illness. She did not mention Israel. Several features in the original video match those in the deepfake, including Hadid's clothes and jewelry, the position of the microphone and the backdrop. Other visual clues indicate the clip was manipulated with AI, including unnatural head movements and moments where her mouth is not synced with the audio. Beyond changing the visual elements of a video, AI tools can also recreate vocals. \"With a small audio sample, an AI voice clone can be used to leave voicemails and voice texts. It can even be used as a live voice changer on phone calls,\" Wasim Khaled, chief executive of Blackbird.AI, previously told AFP. More of AFP's reporting on misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war is available here.",

        "doc": "\"A Chinese woman who claims South Korea is inferior to China is taught a lesson in just five seconds,\" reads the Korean-language title of a video featuring the images, which was posted to Facebook on November 29, 2023. The pictures showing the women facing one another are accompanied by English-language audio of two voices arguing over everything from the origin of kimchi to the success of Korean and Chinese businesses. \"In the middle of a debate between Asians on 'Chinese culture' that was featured on a US debate programme,\" says a caption overlaid on the images. Subtitles also appear on screen that translate the women's supposed exchange into Korean. One of the voices alleges South Korea \"stole\" aspects of Chinese culture including kimchi, a fermented cabbage dish, and that its leading companies are falling behind Chinese firms. The other then refutes the kimchi claim and argues that Chinese companies have failed to replicate the success of their South Korean peers. The debate reflects a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment across South Korea in recent years that has been recorded in surveys (archived link). Kimchi's origins have been a sore point, with South Korean social media users alleging China wrongly attempted to claim the dish as its own in 2020 (archived link). AFP has previously debunked other social media posts falsely purporting to show Chinese people making claims about Korean culture, including here and here. The video of the two women was first posted to YouTube in April, where it was viewed more than 200,000 times, and subsequently shared on Facebook here and here. Comments left by social media users indicated some believed it was a real exchange on US television. \"All Koreans everywhere stand up for our country,\" said one. \"The Korean woman speaks beautifully and forcefully, she put that Chinese woman in her place,\" another wrote. Reverse image and keyword searches on Google and Chinese search engine Baidu found the images of the women were taken from a reality show called \"Hi, City Hunter\" produced by Chinese streaming platform Youku. The programme was also posted to YouTube on March 30 (archived link). It features contestants competing for a job at a top headhunting firm in Shanghai and sheds light on the expectations and goals of young urban jobseekers. The women pictured in the false post appear in a panel discussion between the participants and human resources representatives from different industries on salaries from the show's first episode. The two women are seen interacting on screen at the episode's one hour and 27-minute mark. The first woman is a contestant named Zhou Yichun, who says: \"I previously focused positions in biomedical research and development.\" She goes on to talk about how many years' experience a person with a doctorate or masters would need to earn a salary of 80,000 yuan ($11,200) a month in the field. The second woman in the image is named Chen Chu-ai. She appears a few seconds earlier and discusses the traits of a person earning a salary of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan a month and notes the kinds of job position will differ across industries. Nowhere in the panel discussion do the women mention South Korea or any aspects of Chinese culture raised in the false video. Below are screenshots of the women as seen in the false posts (left) alongside the matching frames from Youku's reality show (right): Separate keyword searches in both English and Korean found no evidence of any US debate programme featuring two women arguing over South Korean and Chinese culture. \"Hi, City Hunter\" can be watched in its entirety here on Youku (archived link).",

        "doc": "\"I can\u2019t wait to ask FBI Director Christopher Wray about this at our next oversight hearing,\" says Republican US Senator Mike Lee of Utah in a November 18, 2023 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. The post includes a message from Derrick Evans, a US congressional candidate and former West Virginia state lawmaker who pleaded guilty to a felony after breaching the Capitol during the 2021 riot. \"Is this person flashing a badge? If so, this would prove there were undercover federal agents disguised as MAGA,\" Evans says in a November 18 X post sharing a screenshot from a video. Similar posts rocketed across X and other platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. Conservative media personalities, such as podcaster Joe Oltmann and Newsmax host Grant Stinchfield, amplified the claims. \"BREAKING J6 VIDEO: Undercover Officer Disguised as Trump Supporter Flashes Badge to Cops As He Enters US Capitol on Jan. 6,\" said the Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that has repeatedly published misinformation about the attack, in a headline shared across social media. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, also repeated the accusation in a post on X. The clip is part of a tranche of security footage the US House of Representatives released November 17 -- but it does not show a secret FBI agent. The man in the pro-Trump hat is Kevin Lyons of Chicago, Illinois, an HVAC technician who in July 2023 was sentenced to four years in federal prison (archived here). Lyons is the latest defendant targeted by long-debunked conspiracy theories about federal officials infiltrating and instigating the Capitol riot, during which Trump supporters sought to disrupt Congress's certification of President Joe Biden's electoral victory. There is no evidence the FBI coordinated with anyone charged in the attack, said Keven Ruby, a senior research associate at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, which had analyzed more than 1,130 related cases as of November 20 (archived here). Trump is slated to go on trial in Washington in March on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The screenshot ricocheting across social media comes from a clip published by the House Committee on House Administration (archived here). Lyons appears approximately 22 seconds into the video. In addition to his red \"Make America Great Again\" cap, he is identifiable by his face scarf, hooded sweatshirt and zip-up jacket. Court documents show Lyons wearing the same outfit in a still of a video recovered from his phone, and also in a photo of him posing with a framed photograph of Pelosi and late Democratic Congressman John Lewis (archived here and here). The agreed statement of facts for Lyons's trial says that the day before the attack, Lyons posted a map on Instagram of his driving route from Chicago to Washington. He said he was \"heading to DC to STOP THE STEAL!\" (archived here), the slogan used by Trump supporters. Once in the nation's capital, Lyons recorded himself marching from Trump's rally near the White House to the Capitol. He riled up the crowd, breached the building and called out for Pelosi. Lyons then entered the speaker's office and filmed himself stealing a wallet from a coat and the framed photo of Pelosi and Lewis. Lyons yelled at police, calling them \"oath breakers,\" \"Nazi bastards,\" \"traitors\" and \"SS\" -- a reference to the elite guard of the Nazi regime. Lyons's attorney said in court filings that his client had spent his entire adult life working as an HVAC technician (archived here). AFP could not independently verify what Lyons was holding in the video released by the House, though the object does not appear to be shaped like a badge. An NBC News journalist and Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman who served on the House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021 attack, both said on X that the item is a vape (archived here and here), or electronic cigarette. Accounts affiliated with the Sedition Hunters, a community of volunteers who have investigated footage and social media posts related to the Capitol attack and provided tips to law enforcement, shared a different shot of Lyons on a street in Washington holding what appears to be a vape (archived here and here). The screengrab comes from a Facebook video posted the day of the attack (archived here). Several people who initially claimed the object was an FBI badge later walked back their allegations. Greene edited her post to remove the screenshot of Lyons and the reference to identification. The Gateway Pundit updated its headline and story to say the supposed badge \"is likely a vape instead.\" AFP has previously debunked other misinformation about the Capitol attack here and here.",

        "doc": "\"5,000 Hamas (Palestinian) rockets attack Israel,\" reads Indonesian-language text in a video posted to TikTok on October 9. The one-minute clip shows huge explosions lighting up the night in a built-up area and has been viewed more than 7.1 million times. It also features a 2009 song titled \"We Will Not Go Down (Song for Gaza)\" by Syrian-American recording artist Michael Heart (archived link). The video was posted after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise onslaught on October 7, 2023, in which they stormed across the border into southern Israel and shot, stabbed or burnt to death more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Hamas said they fired around 5,000 rockets in the early morning assault -- the deadliest attack on Israel since its creation in 1948. Israel has responded by raining air and artillery strikes on Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in the crowded Palestinian enclave says more than 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in the bombing. More than one million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations. Similar videos falsely claiming to show the rocket strikes on Israel have been posted elsewhere on TikTok, including here, here, and here, garnering a total of 81,000 views. However, the footage is unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It shows a US bombing campaign against Iraq 20 years ago that was widely broadcast by major news networks at the time. A reverse image search on Google by AFP led to a similar video published by Turkish media outlet OdaTV in October 2022 (archived link). The clip appears in a text article on US policy towards the Ukraine war that casts parallels with the Iraq conflict two decades ago. This footage on OdaTV bears many similarities to the false TikTok post. Below are two screenshot comparisons between the video in the false post (left) and the genuine footage from OdaTV (right) showing the same frames: A social media post pictured in the OdaTV article refers to the US bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 as \"Operation Shock and Awe\". This term was coined by Washington to describe its bombing campaign that year, which lit up the skies and destroyed swathes of Iraq as the United States and its allies invaded. Scenes of the 2003 aerial assault were widely disseminated by the world's media. A search on YouTube using the keywords \"Operation Shock and Awe\" found a video published by Britain's ITN news network that shows Baghdad being bombed on March 21, 2003 (archived link). One scene at the 30-second mark in the false video shows a building being pounded. It also appears in the ITN footage at the 1:25 mark. The ITN reporter says the building was a presidential palace of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was deposed in the US-led invasion. It can be seen in the OdaTV film as well. Below is a screenshot comparison between the video in the false post (left) and the ITN report (right): CNN also broadcast clips of the bombing (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison between the video in the false post (left) and the CNN video (right): Other buildings seen in the ITN, CNN, and OdaTV videos match those in the false video. After 30 seconds in the ITN report a huge explosion takes place near a tall structure with a clock on its exterior. This building can be seen at the 56-second mark in the false video. It is a major landmark in the Iraqi capital, the Baghdad Clock. It can easily be found on Google Maps (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison between the clock as seen in the false video (left) and a photo of the building from Google Maps (right):",

        "doc": "\"You CANNOT BREAK the Palestinian spirit,\" says a November 12, 2023 post on X, formerly Twitter, from Jackson Hinkle, an American conservative influencer who has repeatedly amplified disinformation about the war in Gaza and other topics. Similar posts spread across X more than a month into the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group whose fighters stormed across Israel's highly militarized border in a bloody October 7 assault, killing about 1,200 people and taking approximately 240 hostages, according to Israel's latest estimates. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said Israel's bombardments have killed more than 11,500 people in the Palestinian territory. The conflict has displaced more than 1.5 million people and destroyed nearly one house in two, according to the United Nations, leaving parents and children sleeping amidst the rubble and hungry families struggling to finance and make the trek south. But the photo of a woman stepping down the stairs of a demolished building with a toy car in her hand is years old -- and from Syria. A reverse image search revealed the photo on the website for the Siena International Photo Awards, a contest run by the nonprofit Art Photo Travel, where it was recognized as a \"remarkable artwork\" in the 2020 \"Documentary & Photojournalism\" category (archived here and here). \"Homs, Syria's third largest city, had been involved in war for four years. A mother, who returned home after the end of the conflict, found her child's toy car in their destroyed house,\" says the caption under the photo, which is titled, \"Mother.\" The shot is credited to Hassan Ghaedi, a freelance photographer from Iran, according to his bio on the competition's website. Ghaedi shared the image to his Instagram account, which is private, in February 2020, writing that it was taken in June 2016. \"The #mother, who returned home after the end of the conflict and has found her child's toys,\" the post says. \"#Homs #Syria. On June 2016.\" Reached by AFP via a direct message, Ghaedi confirmed the details in his post, including the photo's date. The civil war in Syria erupted in 2011 after President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The ongoing conflict has killed more than half a million people, reduced cities to rubble and displaced half of the country's pre-war population while pulling in foreign powers and global jihadists. AFP has debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war here.",

        "doc": "\"Did you ever see a better #Pallywood video than this?!\" says a November 30, 2023 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. The video shows three men arranging themselves in a row on the ground, their eyes closed as though they were dead. Similar posts spread across X -- many invoking the term \"Pallywood,\" a derogatory label blending \"Palestine\" and \"Hollywood.\" The term has accompanied a flood of \"crisis actor\" conspiracy theories accusing civilians from both Israel and the Gaza Strip of faking injuries or deaths to garner sympathy and demonize the other side. Such disinformation has exploded online since Hamas militants stormed across the highly militarized Gaza border into Israel on October 7, taking around 240 hostages and killing about 1,200 people -- mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel's incessant air strikes and ground offensive in Gaza have killed more than 17,400 people -- primarily women and children, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The latest video claimed to show Gazans feigning such casualties predates the escalation of violence by almost three years. The clip comes from a TikTok posted March 26, 2021. The user's Arabic profile says \"Nazareth,\" a city in northern Israel (archived here and here). AFP could not independently verify the context or purpose of the video. But laughter and commentary in the footage suggest it was meant to be comedic. Expressions generally reserved for solemn occasions are heard alongside laughing in the background -- including a phrase often recited at funerals that translates to: \"There is no god but the only God, the martyr is beloved by God.\" The video's caption also includes laughing emojis. Misbar, an Arabic fact-checking service, investigated the video in 2021 and again amid the Israel-Hamas war. The outlet identified the men in the clip as Palestinian influencers who have Down Syndrome, a genetic disorder (archived here and here). Misbar reported they are from the West Bank and that the video was a comedic scene. Other videos show the men drawing crowds and visiting a Palestinian official (archived here, here, here and here). AFP has debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war, including false \"crisis actor\" claims, here.",

Free Palestine. I am ready to help you for the sake of Islam,\" reads the post's caption. The one-minute video has been viewed more than 20,000 times. An unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Hamas, considered a \"terrorist\" group by the United States and European Union, also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom remain captive, Israel says. At least 25 are believed to have been killed. Israel has responded with relentless bombardment and a ground invasion that have killed more than 23,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The clip has been viewed more than 9,000 times after it was shared on TikTok with a similar claim here, here, here and here. However, reverse image and keyword searches on Google and Yandex found all five explosion clips in the video predate the Gaza war. Four of the clips have previously circulated in news reports about a deadly explosion in Lebanon in 2020, and while one is from a fatal blast in China in 2015. The first clip of the video shows a massive explosion seen from a street lined with buildings and parked cars. The clip matches the six-second mark of this video report, posted on YouTube by American broadcaster NBC News on August 5, 2020 (archived link). The video's title reads \"Massive Explosion in Lebanon Kills Dozens, Injures Thousands,\" while the caption says: \"Officials say a warehouse in Beirut had been filled with dangerous, explosive chemicals for years, and warnings about the dangers, they say, were ignored.\" On August 4, 2020, a massive blast at Beirut's port destroyed swathes of the Lebanese capital, killing more than 220 people and injuring at least 6,500, AFP reported. Authorities said the explosion was triggered by a fire in a warehouse where a vast stockpile of industrial chemical ammonium nitrate had been stored for years. Below is a screenshot comparison of the first false clip (left) and the genuine clip from NBC News (right): The second clip shows a blast behind several buildings. It was taken from the 34-second mark of this video report from Canadian media Global News, posted on YouTube on August 8, 2020 (archived link). It is titled: \"Beirut Explosion: Video shows new angle of the massive blast.\" According to the report, the footage of the massive explosion in the Lebanese capital \"was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the second false clip (left) and the genuine video from Global News (right): The fourth clip, which starts at the 29-second mark of the false video, shows another shot of an explosion behind some buildings. It is identical with a video published by AFP on August 5, 2020, titled: \"UGC: Moment of deadly blast in Beirut\". Below is a screenshot comparison of the fourth false clip (left) and the genuine video from AFP (right): The fifth -- and the last -- clip shows an explosion recorded from a jet ski. It is identical with a video published by video-licensing agency ViralHog on its YouTube channel and website (archived links here and here). It is titled: \"Jet Skiers Capture Shockwave from Beirut.\" According to the video's description, it was recorded on August 4, 2020. It also includes a quote from the licensor: \"Me and my girlfriend were jetskiing and suddenly, the explosion occurred. I asked her to jump before the shockwave has reached us. Luckily, no one was injured.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the fifth false video (left) and the genuine video from ViralHog (right): A similar clip, which also captured the Beirut explosion from the water, was published by Global News in August 2020 (archived link). The third clip, which starts at the 10-second mark of the false video, shows a massive fire raging before turning into a big blast. The clip was published by the BBC in a report about an explosion in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin on August 14, 2015 (archived link). \"Dozens of people died and hundreds were injured when a warehouse owned by a company specialising in handling hazardous goods caught fire and exploded,\" the BBC report partly reads. \"Eyewitness Dan van Duren filmed the moment of the explosions, before he and others fled to avoid the danger.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the false TikTok video (left) and the clip published by BBC (right): At least 165 people were killed in the Tianjin blast on August 12, 2015, which was caused by a fire at a chemical warehouse, AFP reported. The Guardian's coverage of the Tianjin blast also used the same footage, crediting it to van Duren as well (archived link). A video obtained by AFP from Chinese state media outlet CCTV at the time shows a similar scene (archived link). AFP has debunked other misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war here.",

        "doc": "\"CHILD SHOT AT IN SCHOOL BY ISRAELI SNIPER,\" says a December 12, 2023 post on X, formerly Twitter. The video posted by Sulaiman Ahmed, a self-described journalist who has shared other disinformation about the war between Israel and Hamas, shows rooms of children shrieking in panic as adults rush to rescue and treat others wounded across a school's campus. Ahmed's post has since been deleted. But similar posts racked up views across X, more than two months after Hamas militants plunged the Gaza Strip into war with a bloody October 7 attack that Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people. Israel's air strikes and ground offensive have left Gaza in ruins and killed more than 18,600 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the Hamas-run health ministry. Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, on December 12 criticized video footage that emerged of Israeli forces blowing up a UN-run school in northern Gaza. But the video shared online is unrelated -- and it does not show Israeli snipers targeting schoolchildren. It was filmed in Afes, a village in the governorate of Idlib, Syria. Using reverse image searches, AFP uncovered a longer, less narrowly cropped version of the same footage on YouTube that appears to show a sign for the Al-Shuhadaa School in Afes (archived here). Voices in the video also mention Afes as they speak using what AFP journalists in the Middle East recognized as a Syrian dialect of Arabic, and a car carries what appears to be a Syrian license plate. Keyword searches for the school in Afes then revealed several Syrian media organizations, social media pages and journalists who posted the same clip -- or parts of it -- to X and other platforms on December 2 (archived here, here, here, here, here, here and here). Warning Show Hide The posts say the recording shows students injured, crying and screaming after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime forces hit the facility with artillery shelling. The first moment when the school was targeted in the town of Afes, east Idlib causing fear and panic among children. pic.twitter.com/s4tc2utwfi Journalist Ahmed Rahhal, who also shared the footage, told AFP in a direct message on X that a teacher captured the film (archived here). The December 2 shelling struck the schoolyard as the boys and girls were playing outside, injuring three children and one teacher, according to reports from the nonprofit Syrian Network for Human Rights, Al Jazeera and the White Helmets rescue group -- whose volunteers responded to the scene (archived here, here, here and here). An aerial picture the White Helmets posted of the destruction shows a basketball hoop and other features from the schoolyard that appear in the longer versions of the video AFP found online (archived here). The group also shared photos of its workers treating one of the schoolchildren from the clip, who is identifiable by his haircut, his red jacket and the wound to his head (archived here). The boy also appears in photos from Turkey's Anadolu News Agency (archived here). Warning Show Hide And additional footage Rahhal took and posted of himself at the blast site shows the same classroom where a bleeding child was picked up off the floor in the video spreading online (archived here). Warning Show Hide The civil war in Syria erupted in 2011 after Assad's crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The ongoing conflict has killed more than 500,000 people, reduced cities to rubble and displaced half of Syria's pre-war population -- while also roping in foreign countries and global jihadists. AFP has previously debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war, including misrepresented visuals from Syria, here.",

        "doc": "\"The earthquake in Japan on January 1, 2024, caused a tsunami with a wave height of 5 meters. Tsunami in real-time.\" reads the sticker text written in simplified Chinese of a clip shared on Douyin, the Chinese version of the video-sharing app TikTok, on January 2, 2024. The 30-second video shows cars on the river bank being swept away and swallowed up by the rushing water. The sound of people screaming can also be heard. This clip surfaced online after a devastating 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Japan on New Year's Day, which has killed at least 92 people and left at least 242 missing, regional authorities said. The powerful main tremor, followed by hundreds of aftershocks, injured at least 330 people. The main jolt triggered waves at least 1.2 metres (four feet) high in the port town of Wajima, and a series of smaller tsunamis were reported elsewhere. The same video was also shared and viewed thousands of times on social media platform X and Chinese social media sites Douyin and Weibo. However, the posts share an old video that has been manipulated to insert the sound of people screaming. The original clip shows a tsunami triggered by the massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which left around 18,500 people dead or missing. A Google reverse image search found a longer video that includes the same footage published on YouTube by an account called Photo Studio Midorikawa on March 13, 2011 (archived link). The video's Japanese-language caption says it was filmed on March 11, 2011 in Iwaki City in Fukushima. The 2011 earthquake remains the worst natural disaster in the country's living memory. It caused a deadly tsunami with waves hitting with such force that homes were destroyed right down to their foundations in many places, leaving areas that were once thriving communities almost entirely featureless. The clip featured in the false post corresponds to the first 30 seconds of this three-minute and 11-second clip on YouTube. Instead of screaming, only the sound of flooding can be heard in the original clip. Below is a screenshot comparison of the clip shared in the false post (left) and the video on YouTube (right): The area shown in the video is the Shimukawa Bridge in Iwaki City, Fukushima Prefecture (archived link). Below are screenshot comparisons of the video shared with the false claim on Douyin (left) and the Google Street View image (right), with similarities marked by AFP: AFP has debunked other false posts linking old clips to the latest earthquake in Japan here and here.",

        "doc": "\"Disney has lost 23 Million Subscribers after trying to cancel Elon Musk,'\" says a December 1, 2023 X post. Other examples of the claim have circulated elsewhere on X, Facebook and TikTok in multiple languages. They come after Musk on November 15 endorsed a post saying Jewish communities are pushing a \"dialectical hatred against whites.\" The statement prompted a flood of departures from X of major advertisers -- including Disney, Apple, Comcast and IBM, who accused Musk of echoing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The billionaire apologized for the post and responded to the backlash in an interview with columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times DealBook Summit. In an expletive-filled tirade, Musk called out Disney CEO Bob Iger and accused advertisers who turned away from X of \"blackmail\" (archived here). However, there is no evidence Disney's move has affected its streaming subscribers -- the statistic shared online comes from a satirical website called the Dunning-Kruger Times. \"Everything on this website is fiction,\" says a disclaimer on the website (archived here). The Dunning-Kruger Times is part of America's Last Line of Defense, a network of websites that \"publishes false stories and hoaxes that are often mistaken for real news,\" according to NewsGuard, a company that rates websites' credibility. The sites are run by Christopher Blair, who told AFP in 2020 that \"confirmation bias\" leads people to believe and share the articles. Although Disney+ has seen a dip in subscribers since its boom during the pandemic, there is no evidence the streaming service has lost 23 million. Disney's latest earnings report came out November 8, before the company pulled ads from X. The document shows 112.6 million core Disney+ subscribers -- down from 118.1 million two years earlier (archived here). Based on last year's reporting dates (archived here), the next report could come in February 2024. AFP contacted Disney for additional comment, but no response was forthcoming.",

        "doc": "\"Boycott Israeli products! Easy way to identify Israeli products. If there are 729 numbers at the beginning of Barcode! It means Israeli product (sic),\" reads a Facebook post from Nigeria shared alongside an image of a barcode. The post further notes that \"729 = Made in Israel\". On TikTok, a campaign to boycott products bearing the 729 -barcode sparked claims that Israel had changed its code to 871 (here and here) and 500 after the movement had gained momentum. Israel has reduced large parts of the Gaza Strip to rubble with a bombing campaign, in response to the bloodiest attack in its history carried out by Hamas militants on October 7. Their unprecedented assault resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel's military campaign has killed at least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry (archived report). The war has triggered global protests and campaigns across the Middle East to boycott products believed to support Israel (archived report). However, the posts claiming that certain barcodes prove that products are made in Israel are misleading. The first few numbers of a barcode \"do not identify the country of origin for a given product\", according to GS1, a non-profit organisation that issues company prefixes for barcodes globally. \"GS1 user companies can manufacture products anywhere in the world,\" it explains on its website. The issue was also addressed in the website\u2019s FAQ section: \"The GS1 Prefix does not indicate that the product was manufactured in a specific country or by a specific manufacturer; it may have been produced anywhere in the world.\" GS1 works with 116 member organisations in countries around the globe. The prefix 729 is assigned to the GS1 member organisation in Israel (archived here). \"Companies around the world can choose any of the 116 GS1 Member Organisations they want to work with, regardless of where they are based or where they produce their products,\" GS1 spokesman Carlos Carnicero Urabayen told AFP Fact Check on January 8, 2023. \"This means that any company no matter where it\u2019s based can work with GS1 Israel or any of the 116 GS1 Member Organisations,\" he said. \"The GS1 prefix, the first three digits of the barcode number, depends upon the GS1 Member Organisation the company has chosen to work with.\" Urabayen also noted that \"companies can choose to work with more than one GS1 Member Organisation to allocate barcode numbers to their products\". The barcode claim has been linked to previous world events \u2014 in 2021 when violence broke out in Jerusalem and at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.",

        "doc": "One Facebook post published on January 7 falsely claimed that social media users could purchase lost luggage that had been left at Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport. Attached to the post is a picture of hundreds of bags and suitcases next to a baggage carousel and a sign that says, \"Lost baggage $3\". The post reads: \"Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport sale lost luggage that has been in store for more than 6 months. According to the regulations it has to be disposed, but we have decided to sell it for just $3 each.\" It encourages users to click on an order button to \"get all the details and participate\". But the link -- which has been blocked by Facebook for not following its community standards -- takes users to a page about a toddler play class, and is unrelated to purchasing unclaimed or lost baggage. Similar posts were shared elsewhere on Facebook here and here, while posts claiming Auckland Airport in New Zealand was selling lost luggage were shared here and here. Spokespersons for both airports, however, told AFP the posts were scams. A Sydney Airport spokesperson said: \"We would urge everyone to stay vigilant to social media scams and only trust information from Sydney Airport's official verified accounts.\" An Auckland airport spokesperson urged users to look for the blue verification tick to identify its authentic accounts. \"Auckland Airport does not sell lost luggage and any page claiming to be selling lost luggage from Auckland Airport is a scam,\" they said. Reverse image searches on Google, TinEye and Bing found the images in these misleading posts originated from photos taken at airports in the United States and Canada in December 2022, when a combination of technological problems and a fierce winter storm led to the cancellation of tens of thousands of flights. One of the images used in the false posts corresponds with an old photo taken at Denver International Airport. It appears to have been manipulated from a photo published on Reddit on December 27, 2022, which stated it showed the airport's baggage claim area for Southwest Airlines (archived link). Southwest was fined a record $140 million by the US Department of Transport over operational failures during the December 2022 \"holiday meltdown\" that stranded more than two million passengers. Below is a screenshot comparison of the altered image used in the false post (left) and the Reddit photo (right): The photo is similar to another taken at the same airport which was published by the online news site Denver Westword here on December 28, 2022 (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the image used in the false post (left) and the Denver Westword photo (right) with corresponding features highlighted in yellow by AFP: A second image purportedly of lost luggage for sale in Sydney was in fact taken at the Chicago Midway International Airport. The original photo was cropped from a photo published by NBC here on December 26, 2022 (archived link). The photo was published alongside others showing how the winter weather was causing travel chaos across the United States. It is captioned: \"A sea of baggage at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the false post (left) and the photo from NBC (right): A third image purportedly of luggage at Sydney Airport was actually taken at Vancouver International Airport. It was originally published as part of an Associated Press report about a snowstorm that halted flights at the airport, published on December 20, 2022 (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the image used in the false post (left) and the AP photo (right): AFP has previously debunked lost luggage scams in the Philippines and South Africa.",

        "doc": "\"A 7.8-magnitude earthquake has struck Honshu, Japan,\" reads the simplified Chinese text overlay of a video shared on Douyin on January 2, 2024. It shows a picture of giant waves washing away cars before flashing a news clip about the plane collision at Tokyo's Haneda Airport a day after the earthquake. The New Year's Day quake that struck Japan's main island of Honshu was actually 7.5-magnitude strong, according to the US Geological Survey. Japanese authorities said on January 5 that it killed at least 92 people. The main shockwave has triggered tsunami waves at least 1.2 metres (four feet) high in Wajima, and a series of smaller tsunamis were reported elsewhere. All around the Noto Peninsula on the Sea of Japan coast, buildings have been flattened and roads have been hit by landslides and fallen trees. The picture has also been shared alongside a similar claim elsewhere on Douyin here and here and on another video platform, Kuaishou. But it is old and shows a scene from the devastating 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan in March 2011 that left around 18,500 people either dead or missing. Reverse image and keyword searches on Google and YouTube found the image shared in the posts corresponds to a frame in a video uploaded on the disaster archive website of Miyako City in eastern Japan (archived link). The site says the video was taken in Miyako in the Iwate prefecture on March 11, 2011 (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the false posts (left) and the keyframe from the video posted by the Miyako City Disaster Archive (right): The same video can also be found in an archived channel run by the Science Film Museum, a Japan-based non-profit organisation that saves old science-related films (archived links here and here). Its Japanese-language caption translates as: \"This footage shows the huge tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. A city employee filmed the second wave (6.5 metres) from the 5th floor of the Miyako City Hall, Iwate prefecture, showing the devastation as the tsunami overcame the four-metre breakwater and swallowed the centre of the city. The voices of the officials tell the whole story.\" Using keywords and features of the buildings in the video, AFP found the location corresponds to Google Maps street view of a coastal highway near Miyako City Hall (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the false posts (left) and its corresponding Google Maps street imagery (right), with similar features highlighted by AFP: AFP has earlier repeatedly debunked falsely shared images and clips from the old disaster that have resurfaced following the recent quake here, here and here.",

        "doc": "\"World Expo disclosed the list of 29 countries that voted for us,\" reads the Korean-language claim shared here on Facebook on November 29. The countries listed in the post are as follows: \"Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Iceland, Austria, Ukraine, Israel, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Turkey, United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Gambia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.\" The claim was shared after South Korea's port city of Busan lost by a wide margin in its bid to host the 2030 World Expo in an election at the BIE General Assembly in Paris on November 29 (archived link). The official results posted by the BIE showed that of the 165 votes cast, Busan received 29 votes while Rome and Riyadh received 17 and 119 votes respectively (archived link). The Saudi capital was named the winner as it received the two-thirds majority of votes as required. The loss by a wide margin came as a shock to South Korean officials, who were quoted in multiple local media reports, including here and here, in days leading up to the vote as saying the race would be very competitive and that Busan had seemingly turned the tide at the last minute (archived links here and here). South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was in Paris less than a week earlier to make a final pitch for the country's bid, delivered a rare public apology to the nation hours after the failed bid, saying he would take the blame for the loss (archived links here and here). The same list was shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here, here, here and here. Dozens of comments left in the various posts indicated many users were misled to believe the list was genuine. \"In the end, it was a fight between the civilised and non-civilised,\" wrote one user. \"Wealthy countries voted for sanity, the poor voted for oil money,\" another wrote. But a spokesperson for the BIE told AFP it has not revealed how member states voted in the 2030 World Expo host election as the vote was carried out in a secret ballot using electronic voting. A spokesperson for the BIE told AFP on November 29 that the only information it has disclosed was the total number of votes. The spokesperson added: \"In accordance with BIE rules, eligible and present Member States, represented by government-appointed delegates, elected the host country in a secret ballot using electronic voting, on the principle of one country, one vote.\" The same information is available on the BIE's official website, which also says the host was elected \"in a secret ballot using electronic voting\" (archived link). Three of the countries -- Australia, Canada and Singapore -- included in the list are not members of the BIE and were therefore ineligible to cast a vote in the 2030 World Expo election on November 29 (archived link). The Expomuseum -- a website affiliated with the BIE dedicated to preserving the history of the exhibitions -- also lists the three countries as among 17 UN member states who are not members of the BIE (archived link). Australia was a BIE member until it withdrew from the organisation after a parliamentary committee said in 2015 that it supported the country's withdrawal, citing the \"high cost\" of taking part in exhibitions (archived link). Canada likewise withdrew from the organisation in October 2012 after its government cancelled its membership as part of a major spending cut, according to the Toronto Star (archived link). Some of the countries on the list in the false posts have openly endorsed South Korea's rivals in the race ahead of the vote. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his country's support for Riyadh's candidacy to host the World Expo, according to a statement from his office on July 29, 2022 (archived link). The Argentine foreign ministry likewise posted its endorsement of Riyadh's bid in a post on X -- formerly Twitter -- on May 23, 2023 (archived link). Uruguay also openly endorsed Saudi Arabia's bid after a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers in May 2023, according to reports from Arab News and the Saudi Gazette (archived links here and here). Israel too had initially supported the kingdom's bid but withdrew its support in favour of Rome on November 27 -- days before the vote -- after Riyadh joined other Arab countries in criticising Israel's combat operations in Gaza, according to reports from the Times of Israel and Middle East Monitor (archived links here and here).",

        "doc": "The false claim was shared here on Facebook on January 3, 2024, one day after Lee was stabbed in his neck during a trip to a construction site in the southern city of Busan. The post suggests that although Lee's attacker was holding a knife in his left hand, he stabbed the opposition leader with a chopstick in his right hand. \"A knife in his left hand and a chopstick in his right,\" the post reads, alongside a collage of three images. \"Is that why Lee rode a helicopter to Seoul, because the chopstick only made a 1cm injury?\" The post refers to an early police statement about the attack that said Lee's wound had a length of about one centimetre (archived link). The largest photo in the misleading collage shows the suspect being subdued. It depicts him holding a weapon in his right hand alongside superimposed Korean-language text that translates to English as, \"You call this a knife?\" Above the image in the top right-hand corner, it reads \"Before the crime, the assailant was holding a knife in his left hand.\" Above the bottom right-hand image, it reads: \"In other words, the assailant had a wooden chopstick in his right hand and a knife in left hand.\" Additional text in the collage reads, \"Therefore, the suspect held a wooden chopstick in his right hand, and a knife in (his) left.\" Lee was surrounded by journalists during a visit to a construction site in Busan when a man pretending to be a supporter pushed through the crowd and lunged at him, stabbing him in his jugular vein. He was first taken to a hospital in Busan, then flown to the capital Seoul where he underwent a two-hour operation, which doctors announced on January 4 was successful in closing his wounds (archived link). Similar false claims about the attack were also shared repeatedly on Facebook here, here, here, here as well as here on X. But the police dismissed the claims as \"misinformation\", saying Lee was stabbed with a knife, local media reported (archived link). Medical professionals who tended to him said his wound was inflicted by a blade. Police investigating the attack said Lee was stabbed with a \"climbing knife\" around 17 centimetres long and with a blade of around 12.5 centimetres. \"After conducting a forensic analysis on the knife, we confirmed that the blood on the weapon matched Lee's blood,\" police said, adding the suspect is believed to have modified the knife to facilitate the crime (archived link). In a live press briefing on January 4 following Lee\u2019s surgery, Lee's surgeon at Seoul National University Hospital also said his neck had a \"stab wound of around 1.4 centimetres in length...inflicted by a knife\" (archived link). Ryu Sam-young, a former police chief and recent DP recruit who was noted by local media for leading the immediate response to the attack, told AFP he saw nothing resembling a chopstick or a similar object at the scene (archived link). The person seen in the top right image holding a knife is a police officer, not the suspect. Kim Ju-hwan, a reporter for the online newspaper Seoul Shinmun, took the photo that matches the second image in the collage. His photo was published in the newspaper's report on January 2 (archived link). \"The person in the photo is a police officer who had recovered the weapon after the suspect had already been subdued \u2013 not the suspect himself,\" Kim told AFP on January 3, adding that he saw no other weapon at the scene. Seoul Shinmun deliberately cropped the upper half of the photo to conceal the police officer\u2019s identity, Kim explained. The image\u2019s caption reads, \"The knife believed to be the weapon used to attack Democratic Party chairman Lee Jae-myung.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo shared in the misleading social media posts (left) and the original photo taken by Seoul Shinmun (right): The person holding the knife in the Seoul Shinmun photo is wearing navy blue cargo pants -- consistent with police uniforms. The image on the left side of the collage was a screenshot taken from the 1:01:10 mark of YouTube livestream footage of the attack captured by Jeong Yang-il TV, a channel operated by one of Lee\u2019s supporters (archived link). The scene shows police officers tackling the suspect -- pictured holding an object in his right hand -- to the ground moments after stabbing Lee in the neck. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image shared in the misleading post (left) and the corresponding frame from the original YouTube video (right): The image at the bottom of the misleading collage shows a police officer holding the knife, as seen from other live footage of the event published by Kim Un-seon TV, a YouTube channel run by a Lee supporter (archived link). The image matches the livestream\u2019s footage starting from 56:52 mark, around three minutes after the suspect had stabbed Lee. Below is a screenshot comparison of the third photo shared in the misleading post (left) and the original footage published by Kim Un-seon TV (right): The footage shows police officers appearing to search the suspect for his weapon, and a person can be heard saying \"Here, I found the knife.\" The officer can again be seen holding the knife at the video\u2019s 57:12 mark.",

        "doc": "\"Tsunami on January 1, 2024,\" reads the Korean-language text overlaid on the video shared here on TikTok on January 1, alongside the hashtags #Japan, #Tsunami and #Earthquake. The footage shows a coastal area flooded by rapid waters and fishing boats battered by intense waves. It was shared after a powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Ishikawa prefecture on the western coast of Japan's main island of Honshu on New Year's Day. Officials say at least 62 people were killed, and more than 300 injured. The earthquake also toppled buildings, caused a major fire and tore apart roads. Waves at least 1.2 metres (four feet) high hit the port of Wajima, and a series of smaller tsunamis were reported elsewhere, including as far away as the northern island of Hokkaido. Warnings of much larger waves proved unfounded and on January 2, Japan lifted all tsunami warnings. The same video was shared with a similar false claim here on social media platform X, as well as here on DC Inside, a popular South Korean forum. But the video shows a Japanese port hit by tsunami waves in 2011, not 2024. Letters and numbers seen on a boat at the one-minute, 10-second mark of the video are written backwards, indicating the footage had been horizontally flipped. A reverse image search on Google using a mirrored screenshot of the footage found it was posted in a YouTube video from user \"wngad869\" on March 18, 2011 -- days after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake that hit northeastern Japan on March 11 that year (archived link). The 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Fukushima triggered a deadly tsunami on Japan's northeastern coast (archived link). The disaster left more than 18,500 people dead or missing. The YouTube video's Japanese-language description reads, \"3:48 p.m. Momoishi Fishing Port, Oirase Town, Aomori Prefecture. 2011.3.11. You can see the chimney of Mitsubishi Paper Mills and the Earth exploration ship.\" Below are screenshot comparisons of the video shared with the false claim on TikTok flipped horizontally (left) and the YouTube video from March 2011 (right): The same video was posted on \"2011 Japan Tsunami Archives\", a YouTube channel that collects footage from the disaster, on June 16, 2022 (archived link). It also credited the video to the user \"wngad869\". Identical footage was also published on the Japanese video sharing platform niconico on March 22, 2011, with a similar description (archived link). Using the description and features seen in the original YouTube video, AFP geolocated the footage to a port area in Aomori, northern Japan (archived link).",

        "doc": "\"WHO agenda to SEXUALIZE Children! You can find this on their website!\" says a January 8, 2024 Instagram post. The post includes a screenshot of supposed instructions for children aged 0-4 to \"learn about masturbation\" and those aged 9-12 to \"have their first sexual experience and learn to use online pornography.\" The caption says the WHO is \"making sure that little children have sexual relationships, learn how to masturbate and use online pornography.\" Similar claims have circulated on X, formerly Twitter. But the allegations are inaccurate. WHO documentation includes information on the sexual behaviors described in the posts, but it does not endorse teaching all of them to infants and pre-teens, according to the agency and independent experts. \"The Instagram post does not differentiate between the standards that the guidelines say need to be included and those that may be included but are optional,\" said Eva Goldfarb, a pubic health professor at Montclair State University, on January 11. \"There is a world of difference there that they ignore.\" The source of the claims is a 2010 document from the WHO Regional Office for Europe, written in partnership with the German Federal Centre for Health Education, titled \"Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe\" (archived here). In it, the WHO explains the importance of comprehensive sex education for children. \"Sexuality education is a broad comprehensive topic and its contents change as the child develops into an adolescent and later to a young adult,\" the agency says. \"At the age of three, a child needs different information and support compared with what he/she needs 10 years later.\" The WHO then presents its observations and guidance for different age ranges. Tables with language similar to that shared in the posts appear starting on page 38 -- some of which the agency identifies as minimum topical standards. However, the information \"can be used in a flexible way to adapt to the specific needs of individuals or groups,\" according to the WHO. \"WHO does not promote masturbation -- or indeed any other act -- in our documents,\" the agency told AFP in a January 12, 2024 statement. \"However, we recognize that children across the world start to explore their bodies through sight and touch at a relatively early age. This is an observation, not a recommendation.\" Leslie Kantor, chair of the Department of Urban-Global Public Health at the Rutgers School of Public Health, confirmed January 10 that there is \"nothing in any of these documents that recommend any behaviors to young people.\" \"All of the recommendations are related to information that would be helpful to young people at different ages,\" she said. \"The truth is, young people have questions about their bodies, they have questions about gender, they have questions about relationships, and we want to be addressing those and giving young people the skills they need to tell truth from fiction -- starting at a young age -- so they can stay safe and healthy.\" Research from academics including Goldfarb of Montclair State indicates school-based sex education helps prevent intimate partner violence and child sex abuse (archived here). \"Evidence shows that young people are more likely to initiate sexual activity later -- and when they do have sex, to practice safer sex -- when they are better informed about sexuality, sexual relations and their rights,\" the WHO told AFP. AFP has debunked a similar claim about the WHO in French here.",

The post's caption of reads: \"A tsunami hit Japan due to a strong earthquake on 1.1.2024.\" The clip, which run for over a minute, shows a large number of objects and vehicles -- including cars, aircraft and a helicopter -- being washed away by a torrent of water. The video has been viewed more than 425,000 times. The post was uploaded a day after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake rattled Ishikawa prefecture, on the western coast of Japan's main island of Honshu, killing more than 200 people, according to official figures. The New Year's Day earthquake triggered tsunami waves as high as three metres (10 feet) high, sparked a major fire in the port town of Wajima and tore apart roads. The clip was also shared alongside a similar claim on TikTok here and here, and on Facebook here, racking up a total of more than 2.2 million views. Similar posts also circulated in Indonesian. However, the claim is false. The video was actually taken at an airport in northeastern Japan after a tsunami in March 2011. A reverse image search on Google, followed by a keyword search in Japanese, found a longer video posted on YouTube by Japanese online media Sankei News on April 28, 2011 (archived link). The four-minute, 16-second video also shows a deluge of water engulfing a runway, with overlaid Japanese text that says: \"March 11, 2011. Filmed by the Japan Coast Guard Sendai Air Base\" and \"Sendai airport hit by tsunami\". According to the video's description, the footage was provided by the Japan Coast Guard. Below are screenshot comparisons of the video in the false post (left) and the genuine video published by Sankei News (right): Sendai airport is located in the city of Natori, Miyagi prefecture, in northeastern Japan (archived link) Japan's northeastern coast was the hardest hit by the 9.0-magnitude undersea quake and the ensuing massive tsunami on March 11, 2011. The disaster left around 18,500 people dead or missing and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The video was also published by Japanese broadcaster All-Nippon News Network and the US-based Wall Street Journal in late April 2011 (archived links here and here). It was later uploaded on YouTube channel \"2011 Japan Tsunami Archives,\" which posts videos shot by witnesses and others of the 2011 disaster (archived link). AFP footage from the time shows the resulting wreckage at Sendai airport. According to the Japanese foreign ministry, Sendai airport's runways and terminal buildings suffered massive damage after the March 2011 tsunami, resuming operations a month later (archived link). AFP has debunked other images and clips from the 2011 disaster falsely shared as the 2024 quake, for example here, here and here.",

        "doc": "\"Ohh, this is terrifying. Earthquake in Japan,\" reads overlaid text in Thai on a TikTok video posted on January 2, 2024. The video's caption also shared it with the hashtags #latest and #todaysnews. The 31-second video shows round objects gradually being swept away by massive waves. The Tiktok video has garnered over a million views and has been shared over 2,000 times. The video circulated online a day after a powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Ishikawa prefecture on the western coast of Japan's main island of Honshu on New Year's Day. Officials say at least 92 people were killed, with 242 missing. The earthquake also toppled buildings, caused a major fire and tore apart roads. Tsunami waves over a metre high struck the port of Wajima, and a series of smaller tsunamis were reported elsewhere, including as far away as the northern island of Hokkaido. The same video has also been shared on Facebook here and on X here. Comments show some users believe the footage was recent. \"We just celebrated New Year's Day. May everyone be safe and god protect all of you,\" a TikTok user commented. \"So scary. Don't it be like the 2011 #tsunami,\" this X account wrote in Thai on January 1, 2024. However, the footage is old and shows tsunami waves hitting a coastal town in Japan's Miyagi prefecture in March 2011. A Google reverse image search using one of the video's keyframes matched a video published on YouTube in 2011 (archived link). The video is longer than the clip shared in the misleading posts. Its Japanese title reads in English as \"Tsunami Ogatsu town Tachihama.\" Ogatsu town is located in the port city of Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture. The area is one of the communities which bore the brunt of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011, with 4,000 of its residents dead or missing (archived links here and here). Below is a screenshot comparison between the misleading TikTok post (left) and YouTube video uploaded in 2011 (right), with key elements added by AFP: The same video and its screenshot also appeared in a blog called \"earthquake 2011\" (archived link). The blog's Japanese title roughly reads in English as, \"Video showing the moment the tsunami approaches right in front of the person filming in Ishinomaki city.\" AFP was able to geolocate the area shown in the video using Google Street View images. The scene in the footage corresponds to the street view image from July 2011 here, in a coastal area of Ishinomaki city, Miyagi prefecture (archived link). Below are screenshot comparisons of the scenes in the video (left) and the Google Street View images (right) with similarities highlighted by AFP: AFP has debunked other misinformation related to the latest earthquake in Japan here, here and here.",

        "doc": "\"Cambridge scientists warn: a quarter of CCP-Covid mRNA vaccine recipients have vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (VAIDS),\" reads a simplified Chinese post shared on December 10, 2023, on X. The X post shared an article published on Slay News, a platform that AFP has previously fact-checked following a similar false claim. The article says one in four people who had received Covid mRNA vaccines had subsequently developed an \"unintended immune response\" that was \"created by a glitch\". The claims also appeared on The People's Voice, and GNews, a site reportedly affiliated with a media group owned by Miles Guo (archived link). AFP has previously fact-checked the sites here and here. A similar claim was also shared in multiple languages on X and Facebook, including English here and here; Japanese here; and Arabic here. Independent experts say VAIDS -- a term used in debunked claims to refer to a weakening of the immune system allegedly caused by mRNA vaccines -- does not exist. \"There is no VAIDS,\" said Rachel Roper, professor of microbiology and immunology at East Carolina University, in an email in October 2023. \"All data worldwide show that Covid vaccines save lives and do not increase deaths\"(archived link). Jason McKnight, clinical assistant professor at the Texas A&M College of Medicine, also dismissed the claim, saying in December 2021: \"There is no such thing as vaccine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or VAIDS (archived link). \"The claim that antibody levels decreasing over months supports the presence of VAIDS is untrue; it's simply a natural phenomenon we see with the immune system.\" The UK study referred to in the false posts was titled \"N1-methylpseudouridylation of mRNA causes +1 ribosomal frameshifting\", however, it did not claim that vaccination causes immunodeficiency (archived link). Its authors -- who were based at UK universities including Cambridge and Liverpool -- told AFP that the claim in the posts was \"simply made up.\" The study, which examined the effects of Pfizer's mRNA vaccine on 21 people, found that one-third of participants subsequently produced unintended proteins. However, the study's lead author, James Thaventhiran, an immunologist at Cambridge University, told AFP on December 20, 2023 (archived link), that \"humans regularly encounter unintended proteins and generate harmless immune responses\". \"Our latest study does not affect the safety assessment of existing mRNA COVID vaccines,\" he said. \"The data are clear: there is no evidence linking unintended proteins and harmful immune responses.\" Lance Turtle, a co-author of the study, also said the claim circulating online had no basis (archived link). \"[This statement] is simply made up,\" the clinician scientist from the University of Liverpool told AFP on December 20, 2023. \"There was absolutely nothing about immunodeficiency in our study\u2026There's nothing immunodeficient about this, it is the immune system responding to a foreign protein.\" AFP has since debunked related claims here and here. It has also fact-checked other inaccurate claims related to Covid-19 and vaccines here.",

Warning Show Hide Similar posts rocketed across Instagram and other platforms -- including TikTok, YouTube and X, formerly known as Twitter -- after the rival military academy teams met for the 124th time. The historic collegiate matchup, known as \"America's Game,\" took place at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts on December 9. Army beat Navy 17-11. But the video has been altered -- the latest in a long line of viral clips edited to add anti-Biden chants. The doctored Army-Navy clip appears to have originated with a popular pro-Donald Trump account on X called \"il Donaldo Trumpo,\" which has previously shared several similarly manipulated videos of the Democratic president and other Trump opponents. The account posted it on X, Telegram and Rumble. The original, unedited footage does show fans jumping and singing -- but not about Biden. Keagan Stiefel, a digital content producer at the New England Sports Network, posted the clip to X on December 9 (archived here). Stiefel later wrote in a separate post that his version had been \"doctored\" (archived here). I\u2019ve never experienced anything like #ArmyNavy. This is an unbelievable atmosphere. pic.twitter.com/58wK80dqru The Army cadets appear to be chanting the tune of \"Tsunami\" by DVBBS and Borgeous, which is playing in the background (archived here). Videos from past Army football games feature the same chant (archived here, here and here). Another post from il Donaldo Trumpo purports to show a cadet holding a sign outside the stadium that says: \"TRUMP WON FUCK JOE BIDEN!!!\" Warning Show Hide Copycat posts later circulated on Instagram, further spreading the false claim that Trump won the 2020 US presidential election. But the photo is also altered.

People in Hokuriku, Niigata and Noto Peninsula, please run,\" reads a post written in Japanese that was shared on social media platform X on January 1, 2024. The video featured in the post shows giant waves toppling boats and swallowing cars on a coastal road. A voice could be heard saying the ground floor of a building is already underwater and that water is rushing in from the sea. The old video resurfaced online the same day a 7.5-magnitude quake rattled Ishikawa prefecture on the main island of Honshu, which officials said on January 3 killed at least 62 people. The earthquake triggered tsunami waves more than a metre high, sparked a major fire and tore apart roads. The video has also been shared alongside a similar claim worldwide by social media users in Greece, India, Japan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand and the United States on various platforms such as Facebook, X, TikTok and YouTube. However, a reverse image search of keyframes on Google found the video was actually filmed following the devastating 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan in March 2011 that left around 18,500 people either dead or missing. The video shared in the false posts had been cropped and horizontally flipped, but it is in fact extracted from this video shared on YouTube by the Japanese broadcaster ANN from the 3:50 timestamp until the end (archived link). ANN's video is titled \"Tsunami, Great East Japan Earthquake\", and its caption states the footage was filmed on March 11, 2011 in Miyako city in Iwate prefecture on the eastern coast of Japan's main island. Below are screenshot comparisons of the video shared in the false posts (left) and corresponding frames from the footage published by ANN on YouTube (right): The number seen on a speed limit sign in the false video -- marked by AFP in the screenshot below -- shows that the clip was flipped horizontally: At the 4:17 and 5:17 marks in the ANN footage, the same voice speaking in Japanese can be heard (archived links here and here). Moreover, a photo published by AFP captured the same scene from a similar angle during the 2011 quake. The photo's caption says: \"This picture taken by a Miyako City official on March 11, 2011 and released on March 18, 2011 shows a tsunami breeching an embankment and flowing into the city of Miyako in Iwate prefecture shortly after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit the region of northern Japan.\" The location of the footage also corresponds to images taken in Miyako on Google Street View (archived link). Below are screenshot comparisons of the video in the false posts flipped by AFP (left) and images from Google Maps (right) with the same structures highlighted:",

        "doc": "\"A citizen taking a walk near a river is washed away by a tsunami caused by the earthquake in Japan,\" reads the Korean-language text in an image shared on Facebook here on January 1, 2024. The image appears to show a man swept away by a torrent of water. The picture was shared hours after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Japan\u2019s Ishikawa prefecture on January 1, 2024, triggering tsunami waves more than a metre high. At least 62 people died while over 31,000 people were in shelters. Warnings of much larger waves proved unfounded, and Japan lifted all tsunami warnings the following day. South Korea also experienced minor tsunamis following the earthquake, particularly parts of its east coast including Busan (archived link). The Busan Regional Meteorological Administration said there was no need to issue a tsunami warning, however (archived link). The same picture also circulated elsewhere on Facebook here, on Korean online forum Arca here, and on Ilbe, another forum which has shared far-right posts, here. However, the image has been altered, with a photo of a former South Korean president inserted into a picture of a stream in Busan. Reverse image searches on Google found the photo has circulated since at least September 2017 on Ilbe, a website whose users are known to share right-wing memes, including doctored images of late South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun to mock him (archived link). The image circulating in January 2024 posts is a slightly cropped version of the 2017 picture. The Ilbe post, which was shared as a joke, makes a reference to Busan, a city in the southern part of South Korea. Using Google Street View, AFP was able to geolocate the structures seen on the image to the Pusan National University subway station, located near Oncheon stream (archived link). The altered pictures and the Google Street View image share matching features, such as the light green wall of the subway station, the shape and colour of the pillars, a descending ramp and stones next to it. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image shared on Facebook (top left), the picture on Ilbe (top right) and the Google Street View image (bottom), with matching features marked by AFP: Another keyword search on Google found the photo of the man in the altered image is taken from one of the pictures published by Roh's presidential library in 2008 (archived links here and here). It shows Roh falling off the sled on a hill in Uiyaji Wind Village, in South Korea\u2019s Gangwon province, on July 21, 2008. Some of the photos were also published on another page on the presidential library website (archived link). They were taken when the former president was spending his summer vacation at Uiyaji Wind Village in July 2008, the page says. Below is a screenshot comparison of the altered image (left) and the original photo published by Roh\u2019s presidential library (right), with parts showing Roh marked by AFP: AFP has debunked misinformation about the 2024 earthquake in Japan here and here.",

It shows a street rapidly turning into a raging torrent, and its caption suggests it was filmed in the central prefecture of Ishikawa as Japan was struck by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the first day of the new year. The January 1 quake triggered tsunami waves more than a metre high, sparked a major fire and flattened houses. At least 62 people have been confirmed dead while more than 300 were severely injured, according to local authorities. All tsunami warnings were lifted after waves at least 1.2 metres (four feet) high hit the town of Wajima and a series of smaller tsunamis were reported elsewhere. The false claim has also been shared elsewhere on Facebook, as well as on TikTok and its Chinese sibling app Douyin. The video, however, is old and in fact shows footage from a tsunami that devastated Japan's northeastern coast in March 2011. A reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the falsely shared video led to a YouTube video published by Japan's All-Nippon News Network (ANN) on January 17, 2020 (archived link). The falsely shared video uses clips from within the first two minutes and forty seconds of ANN's footage. The YouTube post's title reads: \"Tsunami in Kesennuma city, Miyagi / Great East Japan Earthquake [11 Mar 2011]\". Below are screenshot comparisons of scenes from the false video (left) and the ANN footage at the five-second, 19-second and one-minute, 55-second marks, respectively (right): Similar footage from Kesennuma City can be seen at the 13-minute, 16-second mark of a video uploaded by YouTube channel \"2011 Japan Tsunami Archives,\" which posts witness shots from the disaster (archived link). The 2011 quake unleashed a powerful tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing and levelled communities along Japan's northeastern coast. The large blue building seen in the falsely shared video corresponds to Google Street View imagery from Uoichibamae, Kesennuma, Miyagi in eastern Japan (archived link). Below is a screenshot comparison of the false video (left) and the Google Street View imagery from July 2011 (right), with the blue building highlighted by AFP: AFP has previously debunked footage falsely linked to the January 1 earthquake in Japan here and here.",

This claim is misleading; the video previously circulated in reports about a traffic accident in August 2020 in southern Brazil; Portuguese can be heard spoken in the video. The 35-second video was published here on Twitter on August 17, 2020. It has been viewed more than 480 times. The post\u2019s simplified Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cWant to know if this is real. Doesn\u2019t look like a typical car accident. August 15, 09:00: Riot proceeds in U.S. Portland! This video is banned in Hong Kong because the US has banned the video and the European media cooperated with them, the outside world did not know about this; this film was sent privately from a foreign classmate of a certain congressman. Please share this post to let more Americans know what is going on in Portland/the city. August 15, 09:11: This is the actual scene of human bodies being driven through with tanks. \u201d The video was also shared on Facebook here and on Twitter here alongside a similar claim. The claim, however, is misleading. A reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the footage found an identical video published here on Twitter on August 6, 2020. The tweet reads: \u201cWARNING: some scenes may be unsuitable for some viewers. Yesterday from 2-3 days there was a car crash in Brazil after forest fire smoke blew onto highway, who killed a lot of people please pray for them and their family.\u201d Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the Twitter video (R): Closer examination of the video also revealed a voice saying \"My daughter is still alive\" in Portuguese at the 18-second mark. A subsequent keyword search found this August 3, 2020 report by Brazil-based news website Metropoles about an accident involving 22 vehicles on a highway in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais city of Paran\u00e1, Brazil. The report\u2019s Portuguese headline translates to English as: \u201cPhotos show destruction in a serious accident in Paran\u00e1; eight died\u201d. It reads, in part: \u201cA very serious accident involving 22 vehicles on the BR-277, in the region of motels in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais, in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, caused eight deaths on Sunday night (2/8). \u201cThe accident involved a truck, five motorcycles, 15 cars and a Military Police (PM) vehicle. About ten ambulances were called. In all, 22 were injured at the scene.\u201d The incident was also reported by Paran\u00e1-based newspaper Gazeta do Povo here and Chinese state media Xinhua here. The claim was also debunked by Taiwanese fact checking organisation MyGoPen here.",

        "doc": "\"Exclusive Chance for All Australian Residents!\" reads a caption with the Facebook video from November 7. \"The Australian Securities Exchange along with the Reserve Bank have initiated groundbreaking measures to enhance the well-being of Australians!\" Styled as a report by news network Nine, the video opens with long-time newscaster Peter Overton apparently announcing that Australians could \"consistently make $30,000 every month\" under a new \"financial platform\" co-developed by the securities exchange and central bank (archived link). The system \"trades automatically without human intervention\", Overton appears to say in the video. It goes on to show clips of Australia's treasurer Jim Chalmers and former Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe appearing to promote the initiative (archived links here and here). But source footage reveals the clips have been altered, while independent experts dismissed the video as a \"low-quality\" and \"amateur\" deepfake. Nine told AFP on December 11 that the video is phoney. \"Confirming it is a fake,\" assistant chief of staff Andrew Rickert said. A keyword search on Google led to very similar footage of Overton uploaded on October 3 last year. It shows him talking about the Australian stock market and no mention is made of the investment scheme. The genuine footage does not display any headline about an investment plan as seen in the manipulated video. It only contains the logos of 9News and investment research firm Morningstar (archived links here and here). Comparing the clip featuring Lowe with its source footage shows the audio has been altered (archived link). The section in the doctored clip begins after 28 seconds in the real video. The original shows Lowe delivering a speech at an economic conference in Brisbane in mid-July, where he discussed recommended reforms of Australia's central bank following an independent review (archived link). Lowe makes no mention of a new trading platform in either the 20-minute speech or his 28-minute question-and-answer session. Source footage for the clip of Chalmers reveals similar inconsistencies (archived link). The original segment, published by broadcaster Sky News Australia on November 2, shows Chalmers talking about reaching net-zero emissions and the switch to renewable energy. He does not mention any investment scheme. The doctored newscast also contains a montage of old and unrelated clips including this footage from 2008 and 2015 by CNN and CNBC (archived links here and here). While the ability of artificial intelligence to fabricate and alter images has rapidly progressed in recent years, clues still show up in most AI videos exposing their inauthenticity. Common indicators include pixelation or blurring around people's heads, badly synced sound and \"inconsistency across a video, such as glitches, sections of lower quality and changes in the lighting or background\", according to Australia's eSafety Commissioner (archived link). AFP previously debunked another deepfake video that featured a prominent South Korean journalist apparently pushing an investment scheme. Sara Oscar, a visual researcher at the University of Technology Sydney, told AFP in a December 8 email that the Australian video has all the telltale signs of a \"low-quality deepfake\" (archived link). \"What makes the deepfake low quality is that the subject\u2019s face glitches when it is turned from a frontal to a profile position,\" she said of the segment featuring Overton. \"You can also see in a section of the video that the subject\u2019s hand moves up and down repetitively in a slowed motion, this suggests that a sample of video has been taken from a longer clip and looped.\" Daniel Miller, a psychology lecturer at James Cook University, has researched people's ability to detect deepfake videos (archived here). Analysing the Chalmers clip, Miller told AFP in a December 7 email that his mouth movements were \"very mismatched\" with the audio. He also pointed out how the Australian treasurer's voice slips \"into an American accent in parts\". Miller suggested it could be difficult to emulate Australian accents due to a lack of datasets from which to generate the sound. \"I have definitely seen better quality deepfakes,\" he said. The Facebook post appears to link to a news article, but actually directs users to a site that claims people can earn up to Aus$1,800 per day using the trading platform. \"This is an obvious scam,\" Steve Brain of video analytics firm Vix Vizion told AFP in a December 8 phone call (archived links here and here). Brain is Vix Vizion's chief technical officer and has spent more than two decades working on facial recognition software and video analytics. \"This stuff is amateur,\" Brain said, adding that the video relied on psychological cues and not technical strength. Online scams cost Australians Aus$3.1 billion last year -- an increase of 80 percent on the figure in 2021, according to Australia's consumer rights watchdog (archived link). \"It's putting into people's ears what they want to hear,\" Brain said. \"They're not trying to hook everyone -- they're targeting the most gullible people.\" But the potential for harm extends far beyond money, Brain warned. \"They're using people with perceived trustworthiness,\" he said. \"There are very serious implications for political influence, including from state and non-state actors.\"",

        "doc": "\"A McDonalds sign was set on fire by a group of Pro Palestinian protesters because of McDonald's continued support to the IDF,\" says a January 21, 2024 post on X, formerly Twitter. The image circulated elsewhere on X alongside references to an ongoing push to shun the fast-food chain after it offered free meals in Israel. Israel declared war against Hamas after the Palestinian Islamist movement carried out the bloodiest attack in the country's history on October 7, 2023. Hamas fighters crossed into Israel from the Gaza Strip and killed about 1,140 people -- mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel's relentless offensive in response has killed at least more than 25,000 people in Gaza, around 70 percent of them women, children and adolescents, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. As the war continues, activists have advocated boycotting companies such as Starbucks and Zara -- efforts that have been accompanied by misinformation. McDonald's remains the target of backlash after its Israel branch announced on social media in October 2023 that it was donating meals \"to all those who are involved in the defense of the state, hospitals, and surrounding areas\" (archived here). But the picture of the golden arches on fire is unrelated to any boycott efforts. A reverse image search on TinEye surfaced the picture in a Newsweek article from November 27, 2023 (archived here). \"A picture of the Golden Arches ablaze on Whangapar\u0101oa Road, Auckland,\" says the caption of the image, attributed to an area resident. Local media reported people nearby had for months raised concerns about the sign's flickering (archived here). Fire and Emergency New Zealand told AFP it was \"called to a fire at a McDonald's restaurant in Stanmore Bay, Auckland on 26 November 2023, after a member of the public reported a sign was on fire.\" \"It was determined that the cause of the fire was accidental, likely caused by an electrical fault,\" an agency spokesperson said January 22, 2024. McDonald's has previously been the subject of misinformation related to its stance in the Israel-Hamas war. CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a January 4 post on LinkedIn that \"several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald's\" (archived here). In December, McDonald's Malaysia sued a pro-Palestinian group for $1.3 million over its calls to boycott companies allegedly supporting Israel. AFP contacted McDonald's for comment, but a response was not forthcoming. AFP has debunked other claims about the Israel-Hamas war here.",

        "doc": "\"A truck drives through a crowd of #Palestine protesters blocking the freeway in Los Angeles,\" says a December 13, 2023 post on X, formerly Twitter, from an account called \"Salty Texan.\" The page has previously spread misinformation -- including a false claim that another clip showed rioters storming private homes in Washington over the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip. Similar posts spread the video across X after dozens of protesters brought a Los Angeles freeway to a rush-hour halt on December 13. The group behind the demonstration, IfNotNow, says it consists of \"American Jews organizing our community to end US support for Israel's apartheid system.\" Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza have killed at least 20,000 people since early October -- mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The war broke out after militants associated with the Palestinian Islamist movement carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, taking some 240 hostages and killing about 1,140 people -- mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Footage from the Los Angeles highway sit-in showed scuffles breaking out, apparently between protesters and frustrated drivers -- but the clip circulating online is unrelated. \"To my knowledge, no such incident took place last week in Los Angeles,\" Jaime Coffee, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol, told AFP in a December 20 email. Reverse image and keyword searches reveal NBC News posted the same footage June 1, 2020 on YouTube. The news outlet reported it showed a vehicle driving through a group of Black Lives Matter protesters blocking Interstate 244 in Tulsa, Oklahoma (archived here). The May 31, 2020 rally was one of many demonstrations across the United States that month after a white police officer in Minnesota killed Floyd, a Black man. Katie Keleher, director of communications and community outreach for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office, confirmed to AFP in a December 19, 2023 email that the video shows the protest. Steve Kunzweiler, the Tulsa County district attorney, declined to charge the driver of the pickup truck, saying in a June 23, 2020 memo that the vehicle was attacked by demonstrators who had left the protected route for their protest to occupy the highway (archived here). Three injuries were reported. One man paralyzed after falling from the overpass has filed a lawsuit against the state and other parties. Court documents say witnesses claimed they saw the driver brandish a weapon. Other footage from local news outlets and Storyful, a service that verifies and licenses social media content, shows the truck hitting the crowd from other angles (archived here and here). AFP geolocated the video circulating online to a stretch of I-244 in Oklahoma described in Kunzweiler's memo (archived here). AFP has debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war here.",

The video, which shows a tractor-trolley crossing a river, was shared by an account with more than 57,000 followers on February 12, 2024. It came as protesting Indian farmers heading to New Delhi were stalled halfway to the capital by a fortress-like wall of concrete. Police have ringed the city on three sides, blocking highways with metal spikes, blocks and steel barricades, raking the crowds with water cannons and dropping tear gas from overhead by drone. Many of the farmers -- determined to bring their anger and woes to politicians -- have driven on slow-moving tractors across India's northern Punjab state to demand guaranteed crop prices, waving flags, honking horns and chanting protest slogans. The farmers say they launched their \"Delhi Chalo\", or \"March to Delhi\" -- recalling a January 2021 protest when they smashed through barriers and rolled into New Delhi -- because politicians are not listening. The video was shared in similar posts on X and Facebook here, here and here that falsely linked it to the farmers' protest. Some of the comments on a post sharing the video said it was old footage filmed in Anandpur Sahib, a city in the majority-Sikh Punjab state. \"Yes this video is old, it is of Shri Anandpur Sahib Ji,\" reads the Punjabi-language comment. A reverse image search of the video on Google alongside searches for the terms \"Anandpur Sahib\" and \"tractor\" found the video posted on YouTube on April 28, 2022 by a user called Taljinder Singh Cheema (archived link). The video is titled: \"Anandpur Sahib bhakra dam farmtrac 60 epi big trolley.\" Bhakra Dam was built on the Satluj River in 1963. Many small canals originate from the dam in the farming areas of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Farmtrac 60 EPI is a variety of tractor. Cheema's YouTube channel shows several videos of the same tractor-trolley, including here and here. Below is a screenshot comparison of the clip shared in false posts (left) and Cheema's YouTube video (right): Contacted by AFP, Cheema identified himself as a farmer based in Punjab. He said he was driving the tractor-trolley seen in the video. \"This video shows the celebration of the Hola Mohalla festival in Anandpur Sahib in 2022,\" he said. \"Although I am a supporter of the farmers' movement, this video has nothing to do with the recent farmers' protest.\" Hola Mohalla is an annual Sikh festival that promotes messages of courage and defence preparation. Festivities include processions and traditional martial arts displays (archived link).",

        "doc": "\"Around 70 percent of people who died in Japan after receiving a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine lost their lives in the first 10 days following the jab, according to a recent study,\" reads a post written in simplified Chinese that was shared on X, formerly Twitter, on December 15, 2023. \"The peer-reviewed Japanese study, published in the Cureus journal on Dec. 7, looked at the association between Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination and deaths within 10 days of vaccination,\" the post continues. \"The risk period was defined as within 10 days of vaccination, with vaccination day being Day 1, and the control period defined as 11 to 180 days after vaccination.\" The post includes a screenshot of a report by Epoch Health titled \"70 Percent of Deaths from Pfizer Vaccine in Japan Reported Within 10 Days of Jab: Study\". The publication is the health section of The Epoch Times -- backed by the Falun Gong Chinese spiritual movement -- which has previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines. Conspiracy site Zerohedge and Natural News, a website that regularly publishes anti-vaccine articles, also shared similar claims. Both have been fact-checked by AFP for spreading misinformation, such as here, here and here. The misleading claim also circulated in various languages including English, French, Spanish, Korean and Japanese. However, the Japanese study being shared in the misleading posts is flawed, other researchers told AFP, and its impact is \"negligible\". The posts reference a paper published on Cureus.com on December 7, 2023, titled \"Analysis of the Association Between BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination and Deaths Within 10 Days After Vaccination Using the Sex Ratio in Japan\". It is labelled as peer-reviewed. The study used data on deaths reported in a \"risk period\" of 10 days after vaccination with the shot produced by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. While it found reported deaths were concentrated during the risk period for both men and women, it concluded that the numbers were too small to contradict findings by another cohort study in Japan that found no significant increase in all-cause mortality owing to vaccination. The social media posts misleadingly present the results of this study, said Takahiro Kinoshita, a physician-scientist and a member of Cov-Navi, a Japanese project aiming to provide accurate vaccine information which is now disbanded (archived links here and here). Kinoshita explained that the number of deaths used in the study could not be taken as a comprehensive source due to Japan having a passive reporting system where clinicians are only required to report adverse events only when they suspected a link to vaccination. \"Clinicians are more likely to report sudden deaths occurring soon after vaccination \u2013 within 10 days,\" he told AFP on December 21, 2023. \"Therefore, this study does not suggest that the occurrence of deaths after vaccination is higher in the early period compared to the later period.\" He added that the journal was not considered a \"highly impactful source\" and that the impact of the analysis was \"negligible\". Several infectious diseases experts, who were not involved in the study, told AFP the Japanese paper was flawed. For example, the study looked at all-cause deaths -- mortality due to any cause including \"disease, complication, or hazardous exposure\" -- and not vaccine associated deaths, said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Australia (archived links here and here). \"Most of the deaths [in the study] were related to cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death and illness in the world and occurs at a higher rate in men than women, particularly under the age of 65,\" MacIntyre said on December 21, 2023. MacIntyre also noted that people who were prioritised for vaccination against Covid-19 in early 2021 -- the study period -- were older or had multiple chronic conditions, putting them at higher risk of dying regardless of their vaccination status. Chunhuei Chi, professor and director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University in the United States, told AFP that the study omits a critical figure -- the total number of people vaccinated with the Pfizer shot in Japan -- which makes the study easy to misrepresent (archived link). \"The author acknowledged several limitations, including not considering the effects of vaccination after 11 days, and sex bias in reporting deaths, that limited the strengths of the evidence and conclusion,\" Chi said on December 21, 2023. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in the United States, pointed out the study had a \"major flaw\" as it had no control group (archived link). \"A rigorous study would have compared the vaccinated population with a comparable unvaccinated population similar in age and sex distribution with a similar distribution of underlying chronic illnesses,\" Schaffner told AFP on the same day. This methodological bias was typical of most studies claiming higher mortality after vaccines, said Siddharth Sridhar, clinical assistant professor at the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong (archived link). \"Better quality cohort studies invariably find no increase in all-cause mortality after vaccination,\" he said on December 22, 2023. Both Kinoshita and MacIntyre pointed out that hundreds of studies across the world on vaccine safety found no increase in the risk of all-cause death. The World Health Organisation states that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and estimates that in 2021 alone the jabs helped saved 14.4 million lives worldwide (archived link). AFP has debunked hundreds of other false and misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines here.",

These pictures need to go out everywhere! #SayNoToMilitaryCoup.\u201d The photos show several police officers on a rooftop. One of them can be seen pointing a weapon towards the street below. The Myanmar military seized power in a bloodless coup on February 1, 2021, detaining the country's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and declaring a one-year state of emergency. Tens of thousands of people have since taken to the streets to protest against the coup, despite a ban on demonstrations and heavy-handed police response. The photos were also shared alongside similar claims on Facebook here and on Twitter here. Visual clues in the photos, however, reveal they were taken before the protests in February 2021. Two buildings visible in the background of the two images can be seen covered in green cladding, as circled in red by AFP in the screenshot below. AFP located the scene in photos to the Sakura Tower in Yangon on Google Street View. A building seen on the right of the photo in the misleading posts, was photographed covered in green cladding in January 2018. This cladding was removed in a November 2020 image seen on Google Street View, as shown below. The building seen on the left of the photo in the misleading posts can be seen below on Google Street View in January 2018, when the green cladding was visible. However, in a later photo from November 2020, the green cladding has been removed, as shown on Google Street View imagery below. This indicates the photos circulating on social media after the February 2021 coup were in fact taken before September 2018. A spokesperson for Sakura Tower's management company also said in this statement on Facebook that the photos circulating online in February 2021 were \u201cold\u201d. \u201cThere is fake news spreading on Facebook, saying that there are snipers on the rooftop of Sakura Tower,\u201d it said in a Burmese-language post February 10, 2021. \u201cPlease be informed that those pictures are old and not related to the current events. Proof is the building under construction next to Sule Plaza, which was finished a few years ago. \"There are no snipers, police or soldiers on the roof of our building.\u201d The post features several photos that are marked: \u201cTaken on 10th Feb 2021 by Sakura Tower Management\u201d showing a green covering on the edge of the rooftop that is not visible in the misleading photos.

        "doc": "\"Chicago's O'Hare Airport canceled all flights after an American Airlines plane skidded off the runway during a massive snowstorm,\" says a January 12, 2024 post on X, formerly Twitter. The post shows an airline passenger's footage of the aircraft skipping off a frosty runway as it landed, its right wing burying itself in snow. Similar posts spread across X and other platforms, including Facebook and TikTok, as an arctic blast that blanketed parts of the United States with snow and freezing temperatures disrupted travel at the busy Chicago airport. Thousands of flights were canceled daily across the country amid the storms, according to flightaware.com, and O'Hare airport closed temporarily in the early morning of January 12, AFP reported. But the video circulating online is unrelated to the January 2024 flight cancellations -- and it is more than four years old. \"This video is indeed from 2019,\" said Ethan Klapper, a spokesperson for American Airlines, the carrier behind the November 11, 2019 flight that slid off the runway upon landing in Chicago from Greensboro, North Carolina (archived here). Reverse image searches revealed the video featured in news reporting about the incident (archived here, here and here). It was credited to passenger Joseph Lian, who also captured footage after disembarking the aircraft (archived here and here). According to a February 2023 report from the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent agency tasked by the US Congress with investigating major transportation accidents, the skid involving American Eagle flight 4125 saw the plane's right main landing gear collapse and was likely due to deteriorating weather conditions and a failure to close the slick runway, among other factors. It was the plane's second approach to the runway. There were three crew members and 38 passengers aboard the flight, but no one was injured. The FAA reported January 14, 2024 that the left wingtip of an All Nippon Airways flight taxiing for departure at O'Hare airport clipped another aircraft belonging to Delta Air Lines (archived here). But \"there were no incidents involving an aircraft off a runway at Chicago O'Hare during the past week,\" Tony Molinaro, the agency's public affairs officer, told AFP in a January 17 email. The Chicago Department of Aviation, which manages O'Hare and another city airport, added in a January 18 statement that \"the video was not filmed at O'Hare in recent days, as there were no incidents like this one at the airport this month.\"",

        "doc": "\"Trucker Convoy heading to the border,\" says TaraBull, an account that has previously spread misinformation, in a January 25, 2024 post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Do you stand with Texas?\" Text over the video says: \"The People's Convoy rolling through Texas.\" The same clip rocketed across X and other social media platforms, including Facebook and TikTok. The claims spread amid a standoff between the Biden administration and Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott over illegal immigration -- a hot-button issue in the 2024 US election. The state has continued fortifying the banks of the Rio Grande despite a Supreme Court ruling that sided with the federal government in allowing Border Patrol agents to remove concertina wire barriers it had erected. The rising tensions have inspired a parade of truckers who call themselves the \"Take Our Border Back\" convoy. Backed by far-right figures, the group has primarily organized on Telegram and plans to visit several border states, with the first cohort set to depart January 29 from Virginia (archived here and here). The convoy had not begun its journey by January 25, and the video published online that day is unrelated. Reverse image searches reveal the footage has been online since at least February 27, 2022, when it appeared in a TikTok post saying it showed a convoy of trucks on Interstate 40 in the northern panhandle of Texas (archived here). The 2022 clip appears to be a screen recording of another post. AFP contacted the poster for comment, but no response was forthcoming. That collection of truck drivers, known as \"The People's Convoy,\" drove from California to the nation's capital. Inspired by similar demonstrations that crippled Canadian cities for weeks, organizers of the rally protested mask mandates, vaccination requirements and shutdowns intended to slow the spread of Covid-19. On Facebook, one of the People's Convoy organizers said the group is not connected to the Take Our Border Back demonstration (archived here and here). The video circulating online is taken from above the trucks. Waving hands appear at the end, suggesting it was filmed from an overpass. Using Google Maps Street View, AFP geolocated the footage to a stretch of I-40 under an overpass near Groom, Texas (archived here). The freeways, street signs and vegetation visible on Google Maps Street View match those in the video and indicate the trucks were driving eastbound -- not toward Texas's border with Mexico. Other photos show The People's Convoy on other parts of the interstate, including in Amarillo, Texas. The planned driving routes for the Take Our Border Back convoy, meanwhile, do not appear to include the Texas stretch of I-40 (archived here). The convoy's website says its main group planned to depart Virginia Beach on January 29, driving through Jacksonville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, en route to Eagle Pass, Texas -- the site of the standoff between Texas and federal agents (archived here). Roughly 20 vehicles left that morning, journalists tracking the effort reported. A separate group plans to travel from Dripping Springs, Texas, to Yuma, Arizona, starting February 1, and a third is slated to set off for Yuma from San Ysidro, California on February 3. AFP has debunked misinformation about previous trucker convoys here, here and here.",

        "doc": "\"How many times did Israel save the same hostage?\" asks the text of February 12, 2024 post on X, formerly Twitter, with more than 19,000 likes. The user attached several screenshots to the post displaying headlines from The Times of Israel newspaper. The images show titles that announce the rescue of Argentinian-Israeli hostage Har, 70, from Gaza, but one of the articles is from February 12, while the other displays a publication date of December 19, 2023. Users across X propagated the claim that the headlines showed Har had been rescued two times, with one saying: \"Israel telling more lies!\" Posts with the claims were also published in French and appeared on Facebook and TikTok. Har was one of at least 250 people taken hostage on October 7, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas raided southern Israel after breaking through its border with the Gaza Strip. The attack killed about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel responded by vowing to destroy Hamas and began a relentless bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza which has flattened much of the Palestinian territory and killed more than 28,700 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the start of the war, misinformation has been rampant, particularly on X, where users can profit off of posts that receive high engagement. Prisoner exchanges in November led to the release of dozens of hostages from Gaza but at least 130 people are estimated to be still held in the territory. Israel says 30 of those still in Gaza are presumed dead. On February 11, 2024, the Israeli military said Har and another Argentinian-Israeli, Fernando Simon Marman, 60, had been freed from the territory during an overnight operation in the southern city of Rafah. While internet users implied The Times of Israel headlines proved Har's release could have been a ruse, captures of the December 19, 2023 article using the online archiving tool the Wayback Machine, show that the title was updated in February 2024 with information about the rescue. The first archived version of the December 2023 article was saved the same day it was published and reveals that at that time the headline was: \"Taken captive: Argentine-born Louis Har and Fernando Marman.\" There is no mention of Har's release in that version. A comparison of the archives of the page from February 12, 2024 and an earlier version on January 8 indicates the article was updated after the overnight military operation to include the mention that the two hostages had been released. In archive captures taken after the news of the hostages' rescue and the live version of the article, there is an update noted from 8:56 pm on February 12 and an italicized sentence before the body of the text which reads, \"Norberto Louis Har was rescued from captivity in Rafah in a daring military operation on February 12, 2024.\" The Times of Israel also published a new, separate article on February 12 which covered the story of the release of the two hostages with the headline: \"On rescued hostages Fernando Marman and Louis Har\" (archived here). Har's son-in-law recently appealed for a broader deal between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of the rest of the hostages held in Gaza. The Israeli military is continuing ground operations searching for Hamas fighters in Rafah where around 1.4 million Gazans have taken refuge, raising concerns about civilian safety.

The central government is giving you so much for free, yet you are harassing the public and blocking the roads'. #FarmerProtest2024,\" reads the caption of a post shared here on X on February 13, 2024. The 59-second video, which has been reposted over 300 times, shows an elderly woman yelling at a group of protesters sitting in the middle of a road blocking traffic. Speaking in the Punjabi language, the woman says: \"Your demands never end. The government is giving so much for free, even your loans have been waived, yet you sit on the road in traffic jams. After all, what is our fault in this?\" The false video surfaced when protesting farmers heading to the Indian capital city New Delhi in February 2024 have been stalled halfway by a fortress-like wall of concrete. Police have ringed the city on three sides, blocking highways with metal spikes, blocks and steel barricades, raking the crowds with water cannons and dropping tear gas from overhead by drone. Many of the farmers -- determined to bring their anger and woes to politicians -- have driven on slow-moving tractors across the Punjab state to demand guaranteed crop prices. The current protests follow the 2021 farmers' demonstrations, which ended after the Indian government agreed to repeal controversial farm laws that sought to deregulate agricultural markets. The farm union leaders say they took to the streets again as the government has not done enough since the last protest to alleviate their hardships. The video was shared with similar claims elsewhere on Facebook here and here, and on X here. Aashu Gupta, manager of the petrol station who organised the protest -- Saket Filling Station -- confirmed to AFP the video shows a sit-in in 2022 over a dispute between his petrol station and local transport companies and is not related to the farmers' protest. \"Many trucks of a transport service operator used to be fuelled at our petrol station and payment was made at the end of every month. However, they have not paid us for three to four months in a row, so one day we stopped one of their trucks,\" Gupta told AFP on February 15, 2024. \"This escalated the dispute as the transport service operators lodged a police complaint against us. So we staged a protest. Later, the police came and negotiated a compromise. However, the matter is still pending in court.\" He also said the woman seen in the video was travelling in a bus and \"she got upset due to the road blockage and started shouting at the protesters\" and that some farm union leaders had also joined the protesters in solidarity. Sub Inspector Jaspreet Singh of Pataran Police Station also confirmed to AFP that the video shows an incident in 2022. \"This case was about a dispute between the petrol pump association and a transport service owner, in which the transport service owner have filed a report against the petrol pump. The old woman was travelling and was upset with the traffic jam due to the protest.\" Singh told AFP. Keshav Kinker Singala, owner of a coach company which has an office near the protest site in 2022 -- told AFP on February 15 that the video is old and has been falsely linked to the recent farmers' protest. \"This claim is false. The video is from a sit-in protest organised at Saket Filling Station in Patiala district of Punjab in 2022,\" Singala told AFP. Several local media outlets -- including Himachal Today, Scroll Punjab and Focus Punjab Te -- also reported on the sit-in in November 2022 and uploaded videos that show the same scene (archived links here, here and here). Below is a screengrab comparison of the false video (left) and the clip uploaded by Scroll Punjab showing the same scene (right):",

        "doc": "\"The people's convoy passing through Oklahoma!! Freedom,\" says a January 27, 2024 post sharing the clip on X, formerly Twitter. Text over the video says the vehicles are \"Texas bound BABY.\" Similar posts spread across X and other platforms amid a feud between President Joe Biden's administration and Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott over immigration -- a hot-button issue in the 2024 US election. Border agents said authorities encountered a monthly record of just over 302,000 migrants crossing illegally in December 2023. Texas has continued fortifying the banks of the Rio Grande despite a Supreme Court ruling that sided with the federal government in allowing Border Patrol agents to remove concertina wire barriers the state had erected in the area. The rising tensions inspired a parade of truckers who call themselves the \"Take Our Border Back\" convoy to arrange a series of rallies. Backed by far-right figures, the group has primarily organized on Telegram and plans to visit several border states, with the first cohort having departed January 29, 2024 from Virginia (archived here and here). But the convoy had not commenced its journey by January 27 -- and the video that circulated online that day is unrelated. Reverse image and keyword searches uncovered the same footage shared in posts on TikTok and Instagram on February 28, 2022 -- with the identical text overlaid about the number of trucks and funds raised (archived here and here). A post shared by Project War Path (@projectwarpath) The posts indicate that the clip shows an earlier collection of truck drivers, known as \"The People's Convoy,\" who drove from California to the nation's capital in early 2022 to protest mask mandates, vaccination requirements and other interventions to slow the spread of Covid-19. In a pair of posts in a Facebook group for the People's Convoy, one of its organizers said the group is not connected to the Take Our Border Back demonstration (archived here and here). Zooming into the video, AFP identified a highway exit sign with directions to the cities of Chandler and Cushing, Oklahoma, then used that information to geolocate the footage to a stretch of the Turner Turnpike near Exit 166 (archived here). Google Maps Street View imagery shows the same freeway, overpass, street signs, guardrails, grass, shadows and nearby parking lot as can be seen in the video -- and indicates that the trucks were driving eastbound, rather than south toward Texas. The mapped-out driving routes for the Take Our Border Back convoy do not include any roads through Oklahoma (archived here). The convoy's website says its main group planned to depart Virginia Beach, driving through Jacksonville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, en route to Eagle Pass, Texas -- the site of the standoff between Texas and federal agents (archived here). Roughly 20 vehicles left on January 29, 2024, journalists tracking the effort reported. A separate group plans to travel from Dripping Springs, Texas, to Yuma, Arizona, starting February 1, and a third is slated to set off for Yuma from San Ysidro, California on February 3. AFP previously debunked another video that falsely claimed to show the Take Back Our Border convoy here.",

        "doc": "\"In Texas, the frenzy is already turning into chaos. Additional security forces are being assembled to proceed to the US-Mexico border,\" says a January 27, 2024 post on X, formerly Twitter, from an account called \"S p r i n t e r\" that has previously spread other misinformation. Similar posts circulated across platforms, including in Spanish, as Texas Governor Greg Abbott escalated a feud with the Biden administration over immigration enforcement -- a hot-button issue in the 2024 US election. Texas has continued fortifying the banks of the Rio Grande near the small city of Eagle Pass despite a Supreme Court ruling that sided with the federal government in allowing Border Patrol agents to remove concertina wire barriers the state had erected in the area. The rising tensions inspired a parade of truckers calling themselves the \"Take Our Border Back\" convoy to descend on the state, prompting a flurry of misrepresented videos about the situation on the ground. The clip of Texas National Guard forces is also misrepresented -- it dates to May 2023 and was filmed miles away from Eagle Pass in the border city of Brownsville, Texas. Reverse image searches reveal Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin posted the footage to X on May 10, 2023 (archived here). Abbott shared it on X and Facebook (archived here and here). \"The new Texas Tactical Border Force deployed to Brownsville to help shut down a hotspot for illegal crossings,\" the governor said. \"With Title 42 ending tomorrow, Texas will not hesitate to respond to the crisis President Biden has created on the border.\" Abbott announced the deployment in a May 8 press release (archived here). He said it was a response to the expiration of Title 42, a pandemic-era rule former president Donald Trump started using in 2020 to swiftly expel migrants as a matter of public health. The Republican governor said the hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers would \"help intercept and repel large groups of migrants trying to enter Texas illegally.\" They joined thousands already stationed near the frontier as part of a border security initiative he launched in 2021 called Operation Lone Star. Using Google Maps, AFP geolocated the footage to River Levee Road, near the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley's Brownsville campus (archived here). Brownsville is roughly 270 miles (about 435 kilometers) from Eagle Pass, according to Google Maps, which indicates the drive between the two locations takes more than five hours. AFP has debunked other misinformation about US politics here.",

The footage was viewed more than 557,000 times after it was shared with a similar claim elsewhere on TikTok here and here, as well as on YouTube here. It also appeared on social media platform X here, where it was reshared more than 430 times. It was shared days after tens of millions of Indonesians went to the polls on February 14, 2024, in one of the world's biggest one-day elections. Although final official results are not due until March, preliminary tallies on the election commission's website from February 29 show the former general with a commanding lead over rivals Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo. Anies and Ganjar have said, without yet providing evidence, that their camps had found \"systematic\" fraud in the vote and \"the deficiencies are various\". But as of February 29, Prabowo has not made any allegations of fraud in the election. A keyword search on Google found the video was published on Prabowo's official YouTube channel nearly 10 years earlier on July 25, 2014 (archived link). The footage is titled \"Prabowo\u2019s video message | 25 July 2014\". The section of the video where Prabowo discusses the alleged election fraud starts at its 6:21 mark. Below is a screenshot comparison of the false post (left) and the original video shared on Prabowo\u2019s YouTube channel (right): It was also shared on his Facebook page on the same day, with a similar title (archived link). The message was published days after Indonesia's election commission declared the then-governor of Jakarta, Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, as the winner of the 2014 presidential race (archived link). Prabowo alleged there had been widespread electoral fraud and challenged the result at the country's Constitutional Court. But the court dismissed Prabowo's challenge on August 21, 2014, sealing victory for Jokowi. AFP has debunked other misinformation related to Indonesia's 2024 elections here.",

        "doc": "The misleading post claimed Redefine Meat, an Israeli company that makes vegan foods, had set up operations in the Netherlands, and was using animal stem cells to print its meat products. \"A factory in Holland, 3D prints 500 tons of steaks a month,\" an Australian Facebook user posted on January 20, 2024. \"About 110 German restaurants are already buying \"meat\" like Redefine Meat.\" The misleading claim has spread on social media all over the world, with one Hungarian-language post receiving more than 4,600 shares since February 5, 2024. Cultivated or laboratory meat is grown using animal cells that can be obtained without killing the animal (archived link). 3D printing can be also used to shape the product (archived link here). However, as of February 23, 2024, cultivated meat cannot be sold in the European Union. The misleading post's images show plant-based meat alternatives, but only one is a product created by Redefine Meat. The top image was captured from a video report about a Spanish startup that 3D prints vegan meat by Deutsche Welle, with the exact footage seen at the clip's one-minute, nine-second mark (archived link). The bottom image was captured from a Euronews video about Redefine Meat (archived link). Redefine Meat's website states that its products are entirely vegan (archived link). \"All Redefine Meat products are free from animal-based ingredients, thus suitable for vegans,\" the company said. \"In fact, we believe that everyone should be able to enjoy new meat, and they are aimed at omnivores, flexitarians, vegetarians or vegans.\" A spokesperson confirmed this to AFP on February 12, 2024, dismissing the claims on social media as \"false information\". Redefine Meat is \"a plant-based company that uses neither animal stem cells nor animal ingredients,\" the spokesperson said. In January 2023, Redefine Meat founder Eshchar Ben-Shitrit told German magazine Wirtschaftswoche that 3D printers in one of his firm's factories in the Netherlands could produce up to 500 tons of meat substitute made from plant-based ingredients per month -- the same figure used in the false posts (archived link). In the EU, lab-grown meat falls under the Novel Food Regulation and has not been approved for sale in the bloc as of February 2024 (archived link). \"In principle, the cell and tissue cultures can come from animals, plants, microorganisms, fungi or algae,\" Annett Reinke of Brandenburg Consumer Advice Centre -- a German nongovernment organisation -- told AFP in an email on February 12, 2024. \"Cultivated meat and fish from the laboratory are therefore considered novel foods and must pass a series of critical tests and assessments before being authorised for the market.\" When an application is submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the regulator checks if the novel product is safe (archived link). A product may only go on the market after express EFSA authorisation and is then included on an EU list of novel foods (archived link). Conditions of use, specific labelling requirements, or allergy information are also specified, according to Reinke. \"Only novel foods that are authorised and included in the list may be placed on the market in accordance with the conditions specified in the list,\" she said. \"There are currently no such authorisations for laboratory meat.\" She noted that the sale of lab-grown meat was authorised in Singapore and Israel. The European Food Safety Authority told AFP on February 13 that such products must be authorised under the provisions of the Novel Food Regulation before they can be sold on the EU market, saying: \"Of the almost 300 novel food applications we have received for safety assessment since the implementation of the Regulation in 2018, we have not yet received any applications for the risk assessment of food of animal origin derived from cell cultures.\" Some EU countries have made it clear they do not want cultivated meats in their markets. In November 2023, the Italian government banned lab-grown meat (archived link). Months later, Hungary's agriculture minister announced his government planned to follow suit (archived link).",

After Project K\u2019s performance, who stepped on the (visual) image of the Shwedagon Pagoda, Ulsan tower in South Korea caught fire. More (incidents) will be coming.\u201d A fire broke out at a 33-storey tower block in the southern South Korean city of Ulsan on October 8, as reported here by AFP on October 9. The same photos of the fire were published here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim. The claim, however, is false. Project K, a Myanmar boy band founded in 2016, published this post on their official Facebook page here about their performance at the Asia Song Festival in Ulsan. It states they performed at the festival at 8pm on October 10, 2020, two days after the fire at the tower block. Part of the Burmese post translates to English as: \u201cWe, Project K, were officially invited to participate in Asian Song Festival in South Korea in October, 2020.

The video was published on October 13. The first two images in the misleading posts directly correspond with images published in media reports about the fire in Ulsan on October 8. The first image in the misleading posts corresponds with an image in this report by Australian news outlet news.com.au. Below is a screenshot comparison of the first image in the misleading posts (L) and the image published by news.com.au (R): The second photo in the misleading post corresponds with the image in this report about the same fire by Korea JoongAng Daily, an English-language newspaper in South Korea. Below is a screenshot comparison of the second image in the misleading post (L) and the photo in the Korea JoongAng Daily report (R): The images all correspond with Google Satellite imagery of the Samhwan Art Nouveau commercial and residential building.

        "doc": "\"British ship RubyMar sunk by Yemen!\" says a February 19, 2024 post on X, formerly known as Twitter, with more than 10,000 likes, amid escalating violence in the region linked to the Israel-Hamas war. The post includes a video of a cargo ship sinking into the ocean. The caption of a different video published February 19 on X says: \"The moment the British ship sank after being targeted by the Yemeni armed forces.\" Similar claims circulated on Facebook and TikTok -- including in French, Turkish, Spanish and Thai. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels began attacking Red Sea shipping in November 2023, saying they were hitting Israel-linked vessels in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which has been ravaged by the Israel-Hamas war. British authorities said February 18 that a Huthi strike damaged the Rubymar as it traveled through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, forcing the crew to abandon ship (archived here). US Central Command said two anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Huthi-controlled areas in Yemen, but only one struck the vessel (archived here). Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree on February 19 acknowledged the group had targeted three vessels, including the Rubymar (archived here). The BBC reported February 21 that the Rubymar had been damaged by a missile strike but had not sunk and was being towed to Djibouti. But neither video shared online shows the attack. A reverse image search using keyframes from the first video surfaced several social media posts shared months and years before the strike (archived here and here). They show footage of the MV Atlantik Confidence, which sank off the coast of Oman in 2013 after an engine room fire. A Turkish news report about the wreck includes a screenshot from the clip circulating in the false posts (archived here). The second video claiming to show a recent Huthi attack is similarly misused. A reverse image search using keyframes from the clip uncovered a 2020 report and YouTube video identifying the sinking vessel as the Stellar Banner, a \"very large ore carrier\" (archived here and here). The ship was grounded off the coast of Brazil in February 2020 after it deviated from its planned course. Later determined a \"total constructive loss,\" the vessel was deliberately sunk. AFP has debunked other misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war here.",

It's the 4th November in the U.S., and based on the live-stream from USA TODAY, a delivery package from SF Express appeared and many netizens are talking about it. @SF Express International customer service mentioned that SF express packages can only delivery to the U.S. from China but they do not support deliveries within the U.S.\u201d Part of the Korean-language text overlay in the image reads: \u201cA Chinese courier package was spotted during a live broadcast of [US] vote counts. Only USPS envelopes should be seen here, why are we seeing Chinese courier packages here?\u201d The post states: \u201cExposed. #ElectionFraud #Chinese intervention in the US election\u201d. Voters in the US went to the polls on November 3, 2020 to elect their next president. As of November 11, incumbent Donald Trump is yet to concede, but many world leaders have congratulated Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris after the Democrats were declared winners at the weekend. Here is an AFP report on the election. Identical images were also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, alongside a similar claim. The claim is misleading. According to the US Department of State website, US citizens abroad can return their ballots using either \u201clocal mail\u201d or \u201cexpress courier services.\u201d It states, in part: \u201cOverseas voters have a number of options for returning completed ballots: \u201cLocal mail \u2013 If you have a reliable mail service to the United States, put your ballot in the mail with appropriate international postage. \u201cExpress Courier Service \u2013 If time is short or local mail unreliable, you can use professional courier services such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS at your own expense. NOTE: FedEx does not deliver to P.O. boxes.\u201d Below is a screenshot of the relevant section of the website: The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), a group tasked with aiding US citizens and military forces abroad during elections, also noted here that a \u201cforeign mail system\u201d and a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d can be used to return ballots. FVAP said here that use of a \u201cprivate courier\u201d is permitted and recommended in order to ensure a timely delivery. Photo's origins A Google reverse image search found the image in the misleading posts was a screenshot from this November 5, 2020 livestream of vote counts published on the YouTube account of US newspaper USA Today. Below is a screenshot of the livestream at its 5:39:34 mark: The strapline across the video indicates that it shows ballot counters in the city of Atlanta, which is the capital of Georgia state. Below is a screenshot comparison between the image in the misleading posts (L) and the USA Today video (R): As of November 11, 2020, there have been no credible reports of widespread voter fraud in Georgia, according to US media. This report by US broadcaster CNN published on November 10 quotes Georgia's Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, a Republican, as saying there have been no \"substantial instances\" of voter fraud in the state. This video report by Fox5Atlanta published on November 10 includes comments from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who says: \"We have not found any widespread voter fraud\". This report by local broadcaster WRCBtv quotes Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s statewide voting system implementation manager, as saying widespread voter fraud had not ocurred in Georgia during the election.",

According to the caption, it shows Yemen's attack on a Greek ship called \"Zogravia\". The post emerged one day after the Iran-backed Huthi rebels claimed responsibility for a missile attack on a Greek-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea. A source within the Greek maritime affairs ministry told AFP that the ship was a 24-crew vessel called the Zografia, which had been sailing from Vietnam to Israel. Since November 2023, the Huthis -- who have controlled much of Yemen since a civil war erupted in 2014 -- have been targeting what they consider Israeli-linked shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Huthis' attacks and retaliatory US and British strikes have heightened fears of the Israel-Hamas war flaring across the region and disrupted trade in one of the world's key maritime commercial routes. The picture also appeared with a false similar claim on Facebook here and here; as well as on Telegram here, where it garnered more than 2,200 views. It also circulated in Arabic posts on Facebook and X that falsely claimed it showed \"a Yemeni attack on an American cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden.\" However, the picture has circulated in reports since 2015 about an Iranian military drill. A reverse image search on Google, followed by a keyword search, found the same photo was distributed by AFP on its wire in 2015. It was credited to Iran's Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the country's Revolutionary Guard (archived link). The photo caption reads in part: \"Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard troops attacks a naval vessel during a military drill in the Strait of Hormuz in southern Iran on February 25, 2015.\" Below is a screenshot of the photo: The same photo was also published in 2015 by CNN, alongside a description that reads: \"Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard troops attack a mock-up of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during a military drill in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran on Wednesday, February 25\" (archived link). AFP reported that Iran's Revolutionary Guards began naval exercises on February 25, 2015 in the Strait of Hormuz, just a few hundred kilometers away from Western vessels engaged in the fight against the Islamic State group. During the drill, Iranian state television showed an attack by \"high-precision missiles\" fired from the coast, and a helicopter on a replica of an \"American\" aircraft carrier, the report said. Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the false post (left) and the original photo disseminated by Fars news agency (right): AFP distributed other photos of the drill, dubbed \"Great Prophet 9\", credited to Fars news agency, on the same day here, here and here.

        "doc": "Is South Africa the \"rape capital of the world\"? Do 4% of rape cases end in conviction? And is sex education \"non-existent\" in South African schools? These were some of the claims made in an article published online by the Telegraph. ( Note: They closely resemble statistics used in an article published in January 2014 on fellow British media group The Independent's website.) When the article was first published, Africa Check immediately pointed out that Interpol has never labeled South Africa the \"rape capital of the world\". The claim has been circulating since at least 2000 but the organisation, which facilitates international police cooperation, previously told us that \"unfortunately these false reports have been repeated by various media, without verification with [Interpol]\". The claim was then removed without the Telegraph acknowledging the error in the original version. Sexual violence is one of South Africa's most pressing issues. Research guide us to possible solutions. Do the Telegraph's statistics aid in this? We contacted the journalist and asked for the sources for the rest of her claims. At the time of publishing we had not received a response. If we do, we will update this report. Rape rate Claim \"South Africa has one of the highest rates of rape in the world.\" Verdict correct The South African Police Service's most recently released crime statistics showed that 46,253 rapes were reported to the police in 2013/14. That year South Africa had an estimated 52.3 million inhabitants which works out to 87 rapes reported for every 100,000 people then in the country. Figuring out where South Africa ranks globally is harder to do. Statistics on rape in 2013 from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) only list 79 countries, most of them in Europe. South Africa's rape rate is not included on the list, but it is higher than the top three: Sweden (59), England and Wales (36) and Costa Rica (35). Differences in how rape is defined internationally, different ways of counting rapes and the number of cases that are not reported to the police make straight comparisons impossible , however. In England, for example, rape offences are counted according to the number of victims . So if a woman is raped by two men it is recorded as one crime with the offenders acting together. In South Africa, a rape offence should be recorded for every penetration that occurred without the victim's consent. Reporting to police Claim \"Of the estimated 500,000 rapes that take place every year, only one in nine are reported.\" Verdict unproven While we know how many rapes were reported in 2013/14, we do not know how many rapes were committed. To get an idea of that you need to research how many rapes were not reported to the police, but there are no such recent studies for South Africa. South Africa's 1998 Demographic and Health Survey found that 15.2% of women aged 15-49 - or about one in 7 in this age group - had \"sought help\" from the police when they were raped . A 2002 study estimated that only one in nine rapes and attempted rapes were reported to the police. We tried to contact the authors to find out how this figure was calculated and will update the report when we receive clarification. Guilty verdicts Claim \"For every 25 men brought to trial for rape, 24 will walk free...\" Verdict unproven South Africa's National Prosecution Authority (NPA) was unable to give us the number of rape cases that ended in guilty verdicts. Instead they provided the conviction rate for all sexual offences for 2014/15, which was 69%. A conviction rate is the percentage of cases brought to trial that ended in a conviction. For example, 5,484 sexual offences cases resulted in convictions in 2013/14 of the 8,174 cases that went to court, a rate of 67.1% . However, that year there were 62,649 sexual offences cases reported to the police . The police lump all sexual offences in a broad crime category that includes offences such as rape, sexual assault, bestiality, flashing and public masturbation. Sanja Bornman, an attorney at the non-profit Women's Legal Centre , told Africa Check that the organisation had struggled in the past to determine the conviction rate for rape cases. \"It's very difficult to find out how many of the sexual offences convictions were rape convictions. This is because no disaggregated data is made publicly, and readily, available,\" said Bornman. Victim blaming Claim \"According to research by the anti-violence NGO, CIET, 20% of men said the victim 'asked for it'.\" Verdict incorrect Between 1997 and 2000 CIET, an epidemiological research and training organisation, conducted a survey of 2,059 men and 3,967 women in the south of Johannesburg. The survey found that 85% of men surveyed said that they remembered someone who had been raped. Of those men, 16% said that they thought the women \"asked for it\". A gender specialist at the Institute for Security Studies, Romi Sigsworth, told Africa Check that the study's findings could not be applied to present-day South Africa. \"This data... is very dated,\" said Sigsworth. She added that the findings were about an area in Johannesburg and were not nationally representative of South Africa. Gang rape Claim \" In a related survey, a quarter of Soweto schoolboys described \"jackrolling\" \u2013 a local term for gang rape \u2013 as 'fun'.\" Verdict unproven This claim abounds on the internet and the International Business Times and the Mail and Guardian have referred to it, among others. It was reported as early as 1999 by the BBC and The Christian Science Monitor . Africa Check was unable to track down any research that supported the claim, however. Other researchers have tried to verify the claim before, like Katherine Franks, a cultural anthropologist and sex researcher now at American University . In a book she wrote on group sex Franks noted that the claim \"is widely reported\u2026 although the original study is elusive\". Sex education Claim \"Sex education is non-existent\" Verdict incorrect Sex education is part of the South African school curriculum, which outlines what should be taught in each phase of schooling: Grade Topics included in the curriculum R-3 Who may or may not touch my body, practising saying 'no' and how to report abuse. 4-6 How to respect others' bodies, relationships, HIV and AIDS education, gender stereotyping, sexism and abuse. 7-9 Puberty, HIV and AIDS, sexuality, gender equity, sexual behaviour and sexual health. 10-12 Reproductive systems, teenage pregnancy, gender roles, stereotyping, risk of pregnancy, sexually-transmitted infections, abuse of power in society (eg. domestic violence, sexual violence and rape). Sources: CAPS curriculum grade R-3 , CAPS curriculum grade 4-6 , CAPS curriculum grade 7-9 , CAPS curriculum grade 10-12 . Although sex education is compulsory how, or if, it is taught depends on individual teachers and schools, professor of psychology at Rhodes University and expert on sex education, Catriona Macleod, told Africa Check. \"Gender relations and sexual diversity are also supposed to be covered. However, research shows that teachers are often uncomfortable covering sexuality education and may either avoid it or teach in moralistic ways,\" said Macleod. To prevent this, the department of basic education has \"initiated a process of developing scripted lesson plans that lead the teacher through the lesson in a logical and specified way\", their spokesman, Elijah Mhlanga, told Africa Check. Lifetime risk Claim \"Up to 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime according to the South African Institute of Race Relations, but estimates vary widely due to underreporting.\" Verdict incorrect The South African Institute of Race Relations ' chief executive officer, Frans Cronje, told Africa Check that he didn't think the claim originated from the organisation. \"The [Institute of Race Relations] publishes an extraordinary number of documents, articles and publications in any given year\u2026 but we cannot place the statistic cited in the Telegraph nor do we have any immediate recollection of having published that statistic in the past,\" said Cronje. There are no recent, nationally representative statistics on the prevalence of rape in South Africa. Lisa Vetten, a researcher specialising in gender violence at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research, told Africa Check that the most recent research was from a 2010 survey of women in Gauteng . It found that a quarter of women aged 18 and older had been raped in their life time. This data, however, does not apply to the whole of South Africa.",

And as we found out, placing the claims in context paints a different picture.He was mostly correct about South Africa\u2019s dependence on coal and the dysfunction in the country\u2019s municipalities.The president was - technically - on the money with claims about the post pandemic economy, investment pledges, job creation and Eskom power imports.President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s seventh state of the nation address eventually took off, having been bogged down by numerous points of order from the opposition.It is a script that South Africans have only become too familiar with: having struggled to maintain order, the speaker eventually reached the end of her tether and threw many out.When the dust had settled, Ramaphosa sought to rouse a country battered on many sides by various challenges, which he identified as load shedding, unemployment, poverty, crime and the rising cost of living.But in outlining how his administration would tackle these, did the president get his facts right? We took a closer look - and found that while on the surface, the president was accurate most of the time, the devil really is in the details.For example, while hundreds of thousands of jobs have been added in recent months, there are still fewer jobs than before the Covid pandemic.Or take his claim that hundreds of billions have been raised from the country\u2019s flagship investment conferences in recent years. This is correct, but as an expert told us, they are still only pledges.Note: We will update this report as we compare more claims to the facts - so be sure to keep checking back.",

        "doc": "When doctors working in Free State government hospitals went public with a damning whistle-blower\u2019s account in February, the provincial government\u2019s spokesperson, Mondli Mvambi, responded by saying that the province's health system was \u201cnot collapsing\u201d.In a statement issued by Mvambi \u2013 and Makalo Mohale, who is the spokesperson for the Free State\u2019s health MEC, Benny Malakoane \u2013 several claims about the health department were made, suggesting it had made \"significant progress\". The data on which most of these assertions were based is now publicly available and Africa Check has investigated whether the Free State government\u2019s claims match the available data.Background to a \u2018health crisis\u2019FundingThe Free State is South Africa\u2019s second-smallest province by population after the Northern Cape, with a 2014 midyear population estimate of almost 2.8\u2011million \u2013 just over 5% of South Africa\u2019s total population.The province has historically seen poorer health outcomes than South Africa in general and, as far back as 1996, has consistently been ranked as having the lowest life expectancy at birth of all the provinces.In November 2008, a funding crisis caused the Free State to declare a moratorium on the provision of antiretroviral drugs . The complex causes and implications of this moratorium are dealt with in detail in a report by the University of Cape Town\u2019s Centre for Social Sciences The Free State \u201chealth crisis\u201d therefore needs to be understood as one that has continued for at least two decades. Is the province\u2019s health department now making progress as claimed?Claim \u201c[The] department and the Free State have not been getting the right kinds of allocations as per the national formula of the equitable share.\u201d Verdict incorrectImmunisation\u201cEquitable share\u201d is the term applied to how the national government divides the tax revenue pie among national, provincial and local government. This allows provincial and local authorities to provide services such as education, healthcare, social development, housing and infrastructure.To ensure the allocation is fair a standard formula is used for each province. This formula has six components starting with population size and also factoring in poverty levels, economic output, existing services and infrastructure, education enrolment and health risk profile.The latter takes into account aspects such as the share of the population without medical aid and the distribution of chronic diseases in the province.The equitable share formula is not perfect, a health budget specialist at the Rural Health Advocacy Project, Daygan Eagar, told Africa Check: \u201cThe health need component is largely dependent on utilisation data and does not account for unmet needs. So in rural provinces where access is more limited, need will not be accurately reflected because people use services less.\u201dEagar said the formula does not adequately factor in the higher costs of providing healthcare in outlying rural areas, people moving back to a poorer province when they retire or become ill, or infrastructural backlogs. \u201cBut these problems with the formula do not explain why the Free State [health department] is performing so poorly, and the Free State is certainly not at the biggest disadvantage,\u201d he said.Last year the provincial treasury took over the financial management of the Free State health department which had received qualified audits for the previous four financial years National treasury spokesperson Phumza Macanda explained to Africa Check that it \u201cis illogical for the financial troubles of one department to be blamed on a formula that makes allocations across the board with respect to the provincial sphere.\u201cIt is the constitutional responsibility of each provincial government to make budget allocations for each department's requirements and to, in turn, ensure that financial management by each department is undertaken in an effective way.\u201dClaim \u201cImmunisation coverage [for children] under one year improved from 86.8% in 2013-2014 to 91.2% in 2014-2015.\u201d Verdict misleadingClaim \u201c[In 2014-2015] coverage for the rotavirus vaccine exceeded the 95% target and the pneumococcal vaccine reached 91.5%.\u201d Verdict misleadingPneumoniaClaim \u201cPneumonia incidence decreased from 89 per 1 000 of the under-five population in 2012-2013 to 84.7 in 2013-2014.\u201d Verdict mostly-correctTuberculosisClaim \u201cThe tuberculosis (TB) new client success rate improved from 79.7% to 83.3% and the TB cure rate from 73% to 77.1%.\u201d Verdict correctClaim \u201cAll multidrug-resistant TB confirmed patients have been initiated on treatment.\u201d Verdict mostly-correctHIV counselling and testingClaim \u201cHIV counselling and testing is implemented in all health facilities, public places and gatherings. A total of 109 047 people have been tested for HIV so far in the 2014-2015 financial year.\u201d Verdict mostly-correctMother-to-child transmission of HIVClaim \u201c[The] prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV improved from 1.8% in 2013-2014 to 0.09% in the first quarter of 2014-2015.\u201d Verdict incorrectAccording to the Free State health department\u2019s annual report for 2013-2014, 86.8% of babies aged one or younger were immunised. But this was down from 95.1% and 91.7% in the previous two years. The department admitted in its last annual report that it had not achieved its target of 95%, citing vaccines being out of stock, new data policies and poor data management as reasons.The Free State committed to reach 90% coverage in its 2014-2015 annual performance plan with the presidency\u2019s department of performance evaluation and monitoring. The province exceeded this in the first quarter by achieving 91.2%, as was claimed in the press statement.Coverage for the whole year was 90.1%, according to figures that the nonprofit organisation Health Systems Trust received from the national department.However, there are ongoing questions about the reliability of immunisation data in South Africa in general , and actual coverage is likely to be significantly lower than claimed.In its annual performance plan the Free State aimed for 95% coverage for the rotavirus vaccine and 90% for the pneumococcal vaccine.It had exceeded these targets in 2012-2013, when coverage for the rotavirus vaccine was at 99% and that of the pneumococcal vaccine at 95%, according to the Free State health department\u2019s 2013-2014 annual report.It then dropped to 94.4% and 87.8% the next year. For both of these vaccines, a shortage of stock \u201cdue to poor stock management\u201d and \u201creduced rural services due to reduced mobile clinics\u201d were cited as reasons for the decreases.For the reporting year that has just ended, figures supplied by the Health Systems Trust show that the department\u2019s performance is approaching 2012-2013 levels, with coverage of 98.6% (rotavirus vaccine) and 91.7% (pneumococcal vaccine) \u2013 and exceeding 100% coverage in the second quarter for the rotavirus vaccine.This \u201cimplausible\u201d figure shows that the vaccine data \u201creally doesn\u2019t tell you much at all\u201d, said National Institute for Communicable Diseases executive director Shabir Madhi. He explained that vaccine coverage is calculated by counting the number of doses administered and dividing it by the number of children of a certain age expected to be in a district, using past census data.\u201cOne of the major challenges with the vaccine coverage data \u2013 and this is not just for the Free State but for the whole of the country \u2013 is that they don\u2019t have accurate population [data] down to the district level,\u201d Madhi said. To determine actual vaccine immunisation coverage, he said, a survey is needed.Influenza and pneumonia constitute the second-largest cause of natural deaths \u2013 after intestinal infectious diseases \u2013 in South African children under the age of 14 years.The Free State health department\u2019s annual reports confirm the figures stated, but the rate of 84.7 per 1 000 children under five in 2013-2014 is higher than the target of 75.And by comparison, the national average incidence for 2013-2014 was 53.2, as reported in the Health Systems Trust\u2019s annual district health barometer In 2013, the leading cause of natural death in the Free State was TB, followed by influenza and pneumonia, Statistics South Africa\u2019s last report on causes of death showed The department\u2019s 2013-2014 report stated that the TB new client treatment success rate \u2013 an indicator that measures how many newly diagnosed patients completed their treatment \u2013 was, indeed, 79.7%. The cure rate given for all cases was 73.1%.For the past reporting year, the department had committed to reaching a new client success rate of 82% and a cure rate of 75% , which it exceeded in the third quarter of 2014-2015 \u2013 achieving the rates quoted in its press statement.The implementation of a new automated diagnostic test in 2011 has aided the fight against TB immensely, said Christo Heunis, associate professor at the University of the Free State\u2019s Centre for Health Systems Research and Development.His analysis of a decade of TB data in the Free State \u2013 soon to be submitted for publication \u2013 has shown a significant decrease in patients dying of TB since peaking at 12.08% of cases in 2009. One of the reasons for this is that diagnosis within two hours is now possible using special TB testing machines, which means that patients can be started on treatment the same day they are diagnosed.The recorded proportions of patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant TB in the Free State who were started on treatment in the first three quarters of 2014-2015 are 100%, 100% and 83% respectively. The fourth-quarter data (also showing 100%) still needs to be validated.But Helen Cox, an epidemiologist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in drug-resistant TB, said she has some doubts that the Free State health department was able to start all patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant TB on treatment.One reason is that some patients, especially those who are also infected with HIV and are diagnosed late, die before they can be treated. Another is that diagnosed patients who do not start treatment are not entered into the national recording system \u2013 a \u201cbig failing\u201d.Yet the government must be commended for rolling out rapid diagnosis, Cox said, and for increasing the number of multidrug-resistant TB treatment sites \u2013 in the Free State's case, from one to 15.\u201cBut with the new test, the number of patients diagnosed has increased dramatically while treatment has not kept pace, and that\u2019s why we see a treatment gap,\u201d she explained.The Free State is one of South Africa\u2019s top three provinces with the highest rates of HIV infection.Although the province claims to have implemented HIV counselling and testing in \u201call health facilities\u201d, the health department\u2019s own 2013-2014 annual report suggests there was confusion about the indicator . This led to it having to be recalculated to reflect HIV testing offered to those aged 15 to 49.It should be noted that the Free State had the highest prevalence of HIV among those aged 50 years and older in 2012 and this population would have been excluded from this indicator as it currently stands.According to previous annual reports , 534 771 \u201cclients\u201d were tested for HIV in 2013-2014; in the previous year 488 535 people were tested. The figure has dropped to 364 576 people for the most recent reporting year, data supplied by the Health Systems Trust shows.It is important to remember that testing for HIV does not automatically translate into treatment. Repeated stock shortages of antiretroviral medication are of concern in the Free State.This is at the heart of ongoing disputes between healthcare workers and organisations such as the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), and the provincial government, which resulted in the arrest of more than 100 community healthcare workers and TAC members in July last year.The presidency\u2019s data showed that the Free State had a transmission rate of 1.3% in the first quarter, not 0.09%.\u201cNevertheless, it is an excellent HIV transmission rate and less than the [national] target for 2015, which is 2%,\u201d said Professor Gayle Sherman, head of the Early Infant Diagnosis Unit at the National Health Laboratory Service.Edited by Peter Cunliffe-Jones",

Any Kenyan president is required to give a proper assessment of the state of the country each year. In this extensive report, we examine 15 claims in the address. We have again asked the president's office for the source of the data. On 30 November Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta addressed a joint sitting of parliament on the state of the nation, as required by law . In his speech Kenyatta focused on the post-pandemic economy. He also claimed achievements in building roads, schools, electrification, healthcare and more. Did he get all his facts right? We took a closer look at 15 key claims he made, some recycled from his Mashujaa \u2013 Heroes' \u2013 Day speech on 20 October, despite Africa Check having found them to be incorrect or misleading . We have asked the president's office for the sources of the data used in the speech and will update this report when we hear back. \"While most economies in the world shrank, Kenya's economy grew at 0.3%,\" Kenyatta said . He called this \"positive\" \u2013 if \"minimal\" \u2013 growth. It's a claim he also made on Mashujaa Day. Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics d irected us to the most recent economic survey for reliable data on growth. It was published in September 2021. The survey says Kenya's economy shrank by 0.3% in 2020 . World Bank data shows the same 0.3% contraction . And in a speech launching the survey, Kenyatta's finance minister Ukur Yatani also said the economy was \"estimated to have contracted by 0.3% in 2020\". Yatani attributed this to lockdown-related restrictions and a reduced demand for goods and services. \u2013 Makinia Juma The national statistics office has the data to check this claim, John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership thinktank told Africa Check. The data agency publishes quarterly gross domestic product reports, most recently in October 2021. This shows that Kenya's GDP at market prices grew by 10.1% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2020. Uhuru Kenyatta delivers 2021 state of the nation address. CITIZEN TV SCREENGRAB The 10.1% is not \" real GDP \", as the president claimed. It's nominal GDP at market prices, unadjusted for inflation. Not taking inflation into account tends to distort the value of an economy. \"The problem with the president's statement is that we are missing the context,\" Kinuthia said. \"The 'phenomenal growth' was because we are comparing it to a period when the economy was locked down.\" In the second quarter of 2020, Kenya's economy shrank by -5.7%. This was mainly due to restrictive measures aimed at countering Covid-19. Because of their unprecedented nature, a sharp recovery would be expected when these measures were eased, as noted by the statistics office. Prof Charles Wheelan is a senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the US and author of Naked Statistics , among other works. \"This is not a sign of robust new economic growth. It is a sign of recovery,\" he told Africa Check. \"It's not like getting a big raise at work. It's more like being unemployed for a spell and then getting your old job back. It's good \u2013 clearly better than the alternative \u2013 but not a huge sign of progress.\" The president was right that the economy grew by a higher than normal pace of 10.1% in the second quarter, but he left out important context. We therefore rate his claim as misleading. (Find out more about how we rate claims .) \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Data from the statistics bureau shows that the 10.1% growth in the second quarter of 2020 was the highest of any quarter in two decades \u2013 since 2000. We asked the bureau's director-general Macdonald Obudho if there was earlier data. He said there wasn't. \"We do not have any data before that time. We were not generating quarterly GDP data before,\" Obudho said. Kenya gained independence in 1963 , almost six decades ago. But the available quarterly GDP data only goes back to 2000. We can therefore only rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu For historical data, the International Budget Partnership 's Kinuthia directed us to the world development indicators , a World Bank database covering 217 economies \u2013 189 member countries and 28 \"other\" economies. The data shows that Kenya's economy grew by 22% in 1971 and 17% in 1972. The 10.1% rise in the second quarter of 2020 is therefore not \"the first time\" the country has had double-digit economic growth. And Dartmouth College's Wheelan explained that \"double digit growth\" usually means \"GDP growth (stripped of inflation) of 10% a year\". He added: \"The government can credibly say that the economy appears to be undergoing a robust recovery. It's a stretch for them to say they are delivering double-digit rates of growth as that phrase typically is used in a context that suggests policies or developments that are permanently raising the productive capacity of a country, not merely bouncing back after a shock.\" We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu In his delivered speech , Kenyatta said the rise was from 180 to 651 beds. But the text version gives it as from 108 beds. Before the pandemic, he said , there was only an average of two ICU beds in each of Kenya's 47 counties. We checked this exact claim in the president's Mashujaa Day speech and found it to be unproven. Read our detailed findings as to why his numbers still do not add up. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's statistics bureau gives figures on the country's power situation in its yearly economic surveys. The figures come from the electricity utility Kenya Power and the power-generating company KenGen . The 2014 economic survey says the country had 1,717.8 megawatts of total installed capacity in 2013, not 1,300 MW. Similarly, Kenya Power data shows that on 30 June 2013, two months after Kenyatta was sworn in, installed capacity was at 1,765 MW . The president understated the electricity available in 2013 by more than 400 MW. The grid capacity was closest to the president's claim in 2009, when it was at 1,311 MW . This was four years before he took office. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu In 2020, the country's installed capacity was 2,836.7 MW, according to the statistics bureau's most recent economic survey , released in September 2021. Available electricity has increased by 1,118.9 MW since 2013. This is a 65% rise, close to two thirds. Capacity has not doubled. We also checked Kenya Power's most recent report . This showed that on 30 June 2021, Kenya had 2,984 MW in its grid. The increase from June 2013 to June 2021 is 1,219 MW or 69%. There's no evidence that installed capacity has doubled since 2013. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu The increase from 2013 to 2021, according to Kenya Power's most recent data is 1266.2 MW, an average increase of 158.3 MW a year. For Kenyatta's administration to have installed 325 MW every year for eight years, the total increase would have had to be 2,600 MW. We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenya Power says it supplies electricity to \"individual households, private industries, companies and government institutions\". Its 2013 report shows there were a total of 2,330,962 customers connected to electricity. But only 2.1 million were domestic customers, or households. That means about 200,000 were other customers. Kenyatta equates the total customer base to household connections. This gives a misleading picture of households' access to electricity in 2013. \u2013 Makinia Juma Has the Kenyatta administration tripled the number of households connected to electricity? We sifted through Kenya Power's annual reports, and found the numbers in the table below. Kenya Power customers 2013-2021 Year Total customers Domestic customers Increase in domestic customers 2012/13 2,330,962 2,059,340 2013/14 2,767,983 2,481,856 422,516 2014/15 3,611,904 3,305,934 824,078 2015/16 4,890,373 4,565,907 1,259,973 2016/17 6,182,282 5,839,865 1,273,958 2017/18 6,761,090 6,404,632 564,767 2018/19 7,067,861 6,682,137 277,505 2019/20 7,576,145 7,156,429 474,292 2020/21 8,278,203 7,852,051 695,622 5,792,711 Source: Kenya Powe r The increase in domestic customers from 2012/13 to 2020/21 adds up to 5.79 million \u2013 not 6.3 million. The number of households connected to Kenya Power's grid did almost triple under Kenyatta's administration. But the president overstates the increase by about 500,000. His claim is exaggerated. \u2013 Makinia Juma The increase from 2013 to 2021 , according to the most recent data, is 5.79 million \u2013 an average of 726,589 a year. This works out to 1,990 connections a day since 2013, when Kenyatta's administration came to power. The claim is mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's constitution provides for the equitable sharing of money between the national government and the 47 counties. The counties became operational after elections in March 2013. These units of government should receive \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. \"The 15% is the minimum that has to be sent to the counties but, the principle is, the allocations to counties should cover the devolved functions,\" the International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia told us. The Commission on Revenue Allocation assesses the cost of county functions and recommends how funds are shared between national and county government. The recommendations are either adopted or changed by the Division of Revenue Act , if approved by Kenya's parliament . The allocations from 2013 to 2021 are in the table below. ALLOCATIONS TO KENYA COUNTIES 2013-2021 Year Equitable share (KSh billion) (%) of most recent revenues audited and approved by parliament Year of most recent audited revenues 2013/14 190 27.9% 2011/12 2014/15 226.7 43% 2009/10 2015/16 259.8 33% 2012/13 2016/17 280.3 30% 2013/14 2017 / 18 302 32% 2013/14 2018/19 314 33.6% 2013/14 2019/20 316.5 30.5% 2014/15 2020/21 316.5 23.3% 2016/17 Source: Division of Revenue Acts from the National Council for Legal Reporting Going by the equitable shares, the average county allocation over the eight financial years for which allocations have been made works out to 31.6% of the most recent audited revenues. But the \"most recent audited and approved revenues\" are at least three financial years behind, giving a misleading picture \u2013 the percentage allocation looks rosy, but the actual amount is low, Kinuthia said. Ideally, the revenues from the previous financial year should be audited and approved by the national assembly in time for the next budget, but this has not happened. The president's numbers may appear correct, but they only give a partial picture. He omits the context of the 15% as a minimum, the role of the CRA in costing the functions before the sharing is done, and the fact that there's at least a three-year lag between the allocations and the most-recent audited and approved revenues. In the end, it paints a misleading picture. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenyatta said the country's taxman \u2013 the Kenya Revenue Authority \u2013 had collected KSh10.8 trillion since 2013. He added that the amount was \"equivalent to Kenya's GDP\". We checked the authority's data for total revenue collected since 2013. Financial year Revenue collected (trillion Kenyan shillings) 2013/14 0.96 2014/15 1.1 2015/16 1.21 2016/17 1.37 2017/18 1.44 2018/19 1.58 2019/20 1.61 2020/21 1.67 Total tax revenue 2013/14 to 2020/21 10.83 Source: Kenya Revenue Authority . Numbers rounded off. Kenya's GDP was KSh10.8 trillion in 2020/21, according to the statistics bureau. The World Bank's figure is KSh10.5 trillion for 2020. Available data indicates that the Kenya Revenue Authority did collect KSh10.8 trillion in the eight financial years from 2013/14 to 2020/21. The amount is equivalent to the country's GDP in 2020. We rate the claim as correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. Kenyatta made the same claim on Mashujaa Day. But when we fact-checked it, we found it to be incorrect. Our report explains why. What data there is shows that while the ratio has improved over the eight years of the president's term, it was at its highest in 2018. There's also no \"prescribed\" United Nations \"standard\" for a policing ratio. Experts have previously told Africa Check that such a recommendation would have little meaning, given countries' significant differences in police functions and capabilities, and the security challenges they face. Instead, the quality of policing is a better indicator. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenyatta said the Kenya Meat Commission , the state-owned meat processor, has an outlet that \"collects KSh1 million\" every day after the military controversially took over its management. The military had turned it around, he said. The KSh1 million a day translated to an average of KSh30 million a month, he said . But is it KSh3.6 billion a year? Here's the maths. Multiplying KSh30 million (one month average) by 12 (months in a year) comes to KSh360 million, not KSh3.6 billion. The president's figure is 10 times off the mark. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu",

        "doc": "Minister in the presidency for planning, monitoring and evaluation, Jeff Radebe, made a bold claim about Africa's population growth at South Africa's annual presidency budget vote. While emphasising the potential of the African continent and its growing middle class, Radebe said that \"by 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined\". A reporter flagged the claim to us. Minister went off script Director of media and communications in Radebe's department, Tshegofatso Modubu, pointed out that Radebe went off script while delivering his speech. An online copy of his speech shows that he was meant to say \"by 2050, it is projected that Africa will have the same population as China and India combined today \" [our emphasis] . Modubu said that this, entirely different claim, was backed up by the data in the 2015 edition of the United Nations World Population Prospect Report . \"It is estimated that the population of India is about 1.311 billion and China 1.371 [billion],\" she said. \"Combined, they have a population of about 2.6 billion. It is estimated that the population of Africa will grow close to that figure by 2050.\" To be fair, Africa Check decided to judge each claim separately. Let's start with what Radebe said. When he spoke in parliament he made no mention of comparing Africa's 2050 population with India and China's 2015 population. The United Nations report provides population projections for 2015, 2030, 2050 and 2100. In 2015, Africa's population was estimated at 1.2 billion . The combined total for India ( 1.3 billion ) and China ( 1.4 billion ) came to 2.7 billion. Fast forward 35 years and Africa's population is expected to double. By 2050, the continent is predicted to be home to 2.5 billion people. That same year just over 1.7 billion people are expected to call India home, compared to 1.3 billion in China. Their combined population will come in at 3.1 billion. The claim that the continent \"will have the same population\" as India and China combined is therefore incorrect. Population (billions) 2015 2050 Africa 1.186 2.478 India & China 2.687 3.053 Source: 2015 United Nations World Population Prospect Report Now we can move onto fact-checking what the minister was meant to say. An online copy of Radebe's speech shows that he should have added the word \"today\" at the end of the sentence. It's a small but important difference. By 2050, Africa's population of 2.5 billion is still expected to be lower than India and China's combined 2015 population estimate of 2.7 billion. This is a difference of around 210 million people. Or, put another way, a shortfall of about 1 Nigeria, 3 South Africas or 26 Lesothos when current population sizes are considered. The minister's online speech is closer to the truth, although still an exaggeration. Want to find out more about population projections and their limitations?

        "doc": "'One new school a week' Claim \"We opened at least one new school a week in the Eastern Cape last year [2013] and will continue to eradicate mud schools and other inappropriate structures.\" Verdict incorrect An Africa Check investigation into the department of basic education's \"one school a week\" campaign revealed that education officials had staged ceremonial school \"hand-overs\" months after many of the schools had actually opened their doors. Africa Check spoke to 11 schools, which the department claims it \"delivered\" in 11 weeks. At face value, it seems an impressive achievement. But the real delivery dates (when learning and teaching actually commenced in the schools) showed that the department only delivered those 11 schools over 12 months. In one instance, a school had been open for a full year before a formal opening ceremony was held. And at least two schools were declared \"open\" even though construction had not been completed. By scheduling ceremonial openings to take place week after week, the department created the misleading impression that it was opening a new school a week. In reality, many schools promised by Zuma in the Eastern Cape had failed to materialise . Matric pass rate up Claim \"The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61% in 2009 to 78% last year [2013] and the bachelor passes improve each year.\" Verdict mostly-correct The first part of Zuma's claim was true. In 2009 the matric pass rate was 60.6%. It increased to 78.2% in 2013 . However, South Africa's high dropout rate means that many young people never get the chance to write their matric examinations, let alone pass them. When the matric class of 2013 started grade two in 2003 there were 1,111,858 pupils. But by the time they came to sit for their final exams their numbers had fallen to 562,112. (The latest figures from 2014 show that when the 2014 matrics started grade two in 2004, there were 1,085,570 of them. Only 532,860 pupils remained to write their final matric exams.) The second part of Zuma's claim was false. Bachelor passes had not improved consistently each year since 2009. According to the education department, the number of bachelor passes increased from 109,697 in 2009 to 126,371 in 2010 . But in 2011 the number of bachelor passes dipped to 120,767 , before increasing to 136,047 in 2012 and 171,755 in 2013 . (The most recent data shows that 150,752 pupils achieved a bachelor pass in 2014.) Number of children in Grade R has 'more than doubled' Claim \"The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300,000 to more than 700,000 between 2003 and 2011.\" Verdict correct In 2003 there were 315,387 pupils enrolled in Grade R, according to the department of basic education. By 2011, enrolment had increased to 734,654 . These figures include both public and independent schools. (The most recent data shows that 813,044 students were enrolled in Grade R in 2014.) University enrolments increased Claim \"Student enrolments at universities increased by 12% while Further Education and Training college enrolments have increased by 90%.\" Verdict correct Zuma did not give dates for the increases but his claim appeared to have been supported by the department of higher education and training's 2012/13 annual report. It stated that student enrolment at universities had increased by 12% from 837,779 in 2009 to 938,201 in 2012/13. However, demand for university education far outweighs the number of places available. In 2013, the University of the Witwatersrand received over 35,000 applications for approximately 5,500 first year places. Further Education and Training College enrolments increased from 345,566 in 2010 to 657,690 in 2012/13 - a 90.3% increase.

        "doc": "President Zuma's State of the Nation Address on Thursday night focused on land reform, taxation in the mining sector and clamping down on violent protest. You can read the speech in full here . Africa Check asked our readers to identify the most significant claims made by the president - not about what the government will do but what it has done and the state of the nation today. We have fact-checked six of them. So what did we think? How did he do? Access to electricity & water Claim \"You will also recall that Census 2011 outlined the successes in extending basic services. The report said the number of households with access to electricity is now at 12.1 million, which translates to 85%. Nine out of 10 households have access to water.\" Verdict correct According to the 2011 Census the percentage of households with access to electricity for lighting stands at 84.7% and the percentage of households with access to water stands at 91%. The president's claim is correct. New schools replacing mud schools Claim \"With regard to social infrastructure, a total of 98 new schools will have been built by the end of March, of which more than 40 are in the Eastern Cape that are replacing mud schools.\" Verdict misleading Education NGO Equal Education pointed out that claims about replacing mud-schools are a perennial feature of SONA and, while the programme to replace mud schools in the Eastern Cape is indeed achieving results (impressive-looking schools are being built), the president's claim exaggerates the results so far. The original target was for 49 Eastern Cape schools to be handed over by March 2012. That is almost a year ago. To date, only two have been handed over, and while the DBE says another five are 100% complete, 14 are 90% complete and a further 11 are 75% complete, this makes a total of 32 at or somewhere approaching completion. Given this, it seems unlikely 40 will be finished by the end of this March. Hence, the best we can say is 'not yet' and that it seems unlikely to done when promised. The Matric pass rate Claim \"On education, we are pleased that the Grade 12 pass rate is finally on an upward trend. We congratulate the Class of 2012, their teachers, parents and communities for the continued improvement.\" Verdict misleading Africa Check looked recently at claims about the improving Matric pass rate. As we said in our report , Grade 12 results are indeed improving, making what the president said true in the strict sense. The national pass rate in 2012 rose to 73.9%, up by more than 13 percentage points from the 60.6% who achieved a pass in 2009. Education experts point out, however, that this is misleading for a variety of reasons including the fact that some schools are weeding out students who they think will not pass Grade 12, before they take the exam, and others are pushing students to take subjects traditionally seen as easier in order to raise the school's pass rate. The claim is thus true but misleading. The rate of urbanisation Claim \"We should also remain mindful of rapid urbanisation that is taking place. The Census Statistics reveal that 63% of the population are living in urban areas. This is likely to increase to over 70% by 2030.\" Verdict correct The president is correct, at least on what has happened to date. According to the 2011 Census , the percentage of the population living in towns and cities is increasing and 63 percent of the population now lives an urban life. We cannot of course say whether the percentage will hit 70 percent by 2030 and we suspect the president cannot be certain either. But he is correct on what has happened so far. Action to reduce serious crime Claim \"There is increased visibility of the police which contributes to the reduction in the levels of serious crime. The operations focusing on illegal firearms, stolen and robbed vehicles, liquor and drugs which are regarded as main generators of crime have assisted in crime reduction.\" Verdict mostly-correct Crime statistics produced over recent years have shown a steady reduction in the still high levels of serious crime. Determining what precisely has caused these reductions is not simple. Many factors are involved. Late last year, Africa Check investigated a claim from the police ministry that gun controls introduced in 2000 have helped cause the fall in gun crime that has been observed since the middle of the last decade. As our report explains , the evidence (research drawn from mortuary statistics, detailing changes in cause of death), does indeed suggest that the claim is true. We have not, however, seen any evidence about the impact of other aspects mentioned by the president from increased police visibility to operations against stolen vehicles, liquor and drugs. On those aspects, our jury is still out. Life expectancy Claim \"Five years ago, South Africa had such a low life expectancy that experts suggested that by 2015, our life expectancy would have been exactly where it was in 1955. It was with good reason that we were delighted when late last year, studies from the Medical Research Council, the Lancet medical journal and others began reporting a dramatic increase in life expectancy from an average baseline of 56 years in 2009 to 60 years in 2011. These reports also noted significant decreases in infant and under five mortality.\" Verdict unproven This is an important but difficult topic and, for the moment, the jury is out. The president's remarks seem to contradict the reported remarks of Health Minister Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi who was reported earlier this month by The Citizen as saying that life expectancy was \"low\" and around 50. We have not yet been able to confirm these remarks with the minister or check the findings of the MRC or the Lancet. We will look into this further. Conclusion That's up to you. Send us your comments. Let us know what you think of our fact-checks and of other claims that the president made that we could and should be looking into. We'd love to hear from you.

        "doc": "UnrestClaim \u201cWe are a democratic state and recognise the community's right to protest. We however appeal that these protests should be within the ambit of the law and must be peaceful as stated in the Constitution. The police successfully brought under control 13,575 recorded public order incidents, comprising 1,907 unrest-related and 11,668 peaceful incidents.\u201d Verdict unprovenCorruptionThe figures Zuma cited were taken from the South African Police Service Incident Registration Information System (IRIS) database as contained in the 2013/14 police annual report According to the police\u2019s analysis of 2013/14 crime statistics, \u201cWe successfully policed and stabilised 13,575 recorded public order incidents, including 1,907 unrest-related and 11,668 peaceful incidents.\u201d That works out to five unrest-related incidents a day.But the accuracy of the IRIS system has been called into question. According to the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), the \u201cmethodology used to collect the statistics generated by SAPS IRIS is unclear; as is the level of detail of each incident\u201d.Lizette Lancaster, head of the Crime and Justice Hub at the ISS, told Africa Check the collection of statistics on public order incidents \u201cis not audited and doesn\u2019t follow the same processes used to verify the crime statistics\u201d.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how these incidents are recorded and as far as we can tell the collection of data is very ad-hoc. And like all other crime statistics, they are not independently audited or verified.\u201dPeaceful public order incidents include everything from small town fetes where police are deployed, to rock concerts, sports events, political rallies and legal demonstrations.According to Lancaster, the number of incidents reported are of concern because there is \u201cnot enough police capacity on the ground to deal with unrest incidents, it consumes a huge amount of resources and this detracts from ordinary crime prevention operations\u201d. Crime categories that people fear most have increased over the past two yearsClaim \u201cThe fight against corruption continues to be taken forward by the Anti-Corruption Inter-Ministerial Committee. Government has in place seven anti-corruption institutions and 17 pieces of legislation which are intended to combat corruption. This demonstrates a concerted effort by government to break the back of this scourge in the country. In the 2013/14 financial year, 52 persons were convicted in cases involving more than R5-million. Thirty one public servants were convicted in the first quarter of 2014/15 and freezing orders to the value of R430-million were obtained.\" Verdict downplayedYouth employmentClaim \u201cOur investment in youth employment is also paying off. The Employment Tax Incentive [ETI] which was introduced last year directed mainly at the youth, is progressing very well. R2-billion has been claimed to date by some 29,000 employers, who have claimed for at least 270,000 young people.\u201d Verdict unprovenSchool infrastructureClaim \u201cThrough the Accelerated School Infrastructure Delivery Initiative [ASIDI] which is part of the national infrastructure plan, 92 schools have been completed to date and 108 are under construction. About 342 schools have received water for the first time. Three hundred and fifty one schools have received decent sanitation while 288 have been connected to electricity.\" Verdict unprovenOnce again Zuma\u2019s comments appear to be correct on the numbers but lacking in context. Corruption Watch, a non-profit established in 2012 to track corruption in South Africa, said Zuma\u2019s speech \u201cdithered around the topic that has many South Africans concerned about the future of his government\u201d.Many South Africans clearly don\u2019t believe the president\u2019s claim that there is a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d to crack down on corruption. Perceptions of corruption in government have been increasing steadily since 2002 . According to a paper published by the ISS, the heart of the problem \u201clies in the lack of accountability for maladministration and corruption\u201d.\u201cCorruption Watch states that this problem starts with the President \u2013 while there are various efforts by the government to tackle corruption, \u2018these actions were countered by the continuing impunity on the part of those who were politically and financially powerful\u2019.According to Statistics South Africa\u2019s 2013/14 Victims of Crime Survey , which was published in December: \u201cMore than 70% of households believed that corruption had increased during the period 2010\u20132013. Over three-quarters of households thought people were involved in corruption to get rich quickly (76.9%). Bribes were commonly paid in order to speed up procedures (37.9%), followed by receiving better treatment (23%) and to avoid traffic fines.\u201dThere are at least eleven agencies in South Africa that have a mandate to investigate corruption.But a number of key anti-corruption institutions are in turmoil. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is without a permanent head following the resignation of Vas Soni in January . The Hawks \u2013 who are meant to investigate organised crime and corruption cases \u2013 has reportedly been plunged into disarray with the suspension of its head, Anwa Dramat . There are also concerns about the independence of the National Prosecuting Authority.The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is under pressure with the suspensions of key managers amid allegations of a \u201crogue investigations unit\u201d. Some have argued that SARS is being \u201cpurged\u201d as a result of politically sensitive investigations into Zuma\u2019s cousin Khulubuse and the holding up of a multi-million rand consignment of ANC election t-shirts . SARS have denied the allegations Then there is what has been described as the \u201cneopatrimonial\u201d character of the Zuma presidency and accusations that the president has surrounded himself with loyal acolytes who will protect him at any cost . Add to this the controversy over the president\u2019s R250-million Nkandla homestead and demands by opposition parties that he \u201cpay back the money\u201d.South Africa\u2019s youth are in a dire situation. Recently released data from Stats SA shows that nearly half ( 48.8% ) of all people aged 15 to 24 are unemployed according to the narrow definition of unemployment . According to the broad definition of unemployment (which includes people that want to work but are not actively searching for a job as they have lost hope, want to work but can\u2019t find jobs in the area or are unable to find work that requires their skills) 63.6% are unemployed.The Employment Tax Incentive (ETI) came into effect on 1 January 2014. It encourages employers to hire new, young and less experienced people aged between 18 and 29 by lowering the cost of employing them through a cost-sharing mechanism with government.The ETI is scheduled to end on 31 December 2016 . National Treasury has said that the incentive\u2019s effectiveness will be reviewed to determine whether or not it will be continued after that.The incentive is administered by the South African Revenue Service\u2019s (SARS) payroll system but SARS was unable to provide any evidence to support the claim. \u201cThe info in the SONA speech comes from SARS numbers. There is no publicly available documentation, since the figures come from tax returns on the SARS system,\u201d Marika Muller, SARS deputy spokesperson, told Africa Check.Zuma\u2019s claim that the incentive is \u201cprogressing well\u201d is questionable in light of a new study. A recent report released by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit found that the ETI \u201cdid not have any statistically significant and positive effects on youth employment probabilities\u201d. The study only looked at the first six months of 2014. Discussing his findings, co-author of the study associate professor Vimal Ranchhod pointed out that although employers may be claiming tax relief for 270,000 employees this did not necessarily mean that 270,000 new jobs were created since 1 January 2014. He said that a portion of those young people would have been employed without the introduction of the ETI through normal turnover and job creation. In those cases employers would receive tax relief for people that they would have employed normally.Professor Imraan Valodia, Dean of Commerce, Law and Management at Wits University, told Africa Check it was too early to comment on the success of the ETI: \u201cI think the overwhelming evidence on the ETI is that it is much too early to tell [if it is progressing well]. While it is pleasing to see employers taking up the scheme we really don\u2019t yet know whether they are simply replacing older workers with younger workers.\u201d ASIDI is a school building programme undertaken by the department of basic education to replace unsafe and \u201cinappropriate\u201d school structures and connect schools to basic services.ASIDI identified 496 schools that were considered \u201cinappropriate structures\u201d. 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and 346 schools in 2013/14. The ASIDI programme is far behind its target. The 92 schools mentioned by Zuma should have been delivered during 2012/13. By March last year 496 should have been completed.The connection of schools to basic services is also behind target. By 2012/13 1,257 schools should have been connected to water, 878 schools connected to electricity and 868 schools connected to sanitation.The department of basic education\u2019s spokesman, Elijah Mhlanga, told Africa Check that Zuma\u2019s numbers were correct. We requested the names and the completion dates of the schools but have yet to receive them. We will update this report if and when we receive them.Zukiswa Kota, an education researcher at the Public Service Accountability Monitor , told Africa Check that fact-checking ASIDI figures was problematic. \u201cIt is very difficult to monitor the performance of ASIDI and its milestones. No one really at this point can say what the correct figures are because no one has conducted a physical check of all the schools. Not even parliament,\u201d she said.She said that there was also confusion about the actual completion dates of the schools \u2013 when teaching and learning commenced. Africa Check highlighted this problem in a previous report",

        "doc": "In his 2021 Madaraka Day speech, president Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenya's gross domestic product at independence in 1963 was KSh6.4 billion. This is mostly correct. But his claim that this was increased to KSh4.5 trillion in the following 50 years is misleading. He claimed his administration had doubled the GDP achieved by \"the colonisers and the first three administrations\". This is also misleading. Two claims about the national government's allocations to Kenya's 47 counties are understated. And claims about issuing more title deeds to land, and improved renal health facilities, are mostly correct. With just over a year left in his presidency, Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta has been highlighting his administration's achievements since he took office in 2013. His second and final term is set to end in August 2022. A notable theme in his recent statements has been comparing his legacy with that of his predecessors. On 1 June 2021, in a speech marking 58 years of self rule on Kenya's Madaraka Day national holiday, Kenyatta drew attention to economic growth and improvements in healthcare, among other areas. We looked at seven claims in his speech . We have asked the presidency to comment on our findings. Kenyatta said that \"after 74 years of colonial occupation, that was what Kenya was worth every year\". Kenya became independent on 12 December 1963. A country's gross domestic product is an attempt to measure the size of its economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. For historical data on GDP, we consulted John Kinuthia , senior programmes officer at IBP Kenya , the Kenyan arm of the International Budget Partnership budget transparency think tank. He directed us to the World Bank 's data portal .  This is compiled from the national accounts of individual member countries. It shows that in 1963, Kenya's GDP was KSh6.6 billion in that year's prices, a measure known as current GDP. We therefore rate the president's claim as mostly correct. Kenyatta's three predecessors, including his father Jomo Kenyatta, were in office from independence in 1963 to 2013. We asked Benjamin Muchiri, who is in charge of national accounts at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , how GDP should be compared across several years. It was important to adjust for inflation, he said. \"When we are reporting GDP for 2020, it is based on 2020 prices, and 2019 GDP would be based on 2019 prices. When we say current GDP it means that at the respective year price,\" Muchiri said. He gave the example of a farmer selling 100 bags of maize at KSh3,000 this year. His output would be KSh300,000. Next year, if the farmer produced the same number of bags but sold each for KSh4,000, their output would be KSh400,000. \"In actual sense, your output has not changed,\" he said. \"It is the same 100 bags, but the prices have gone up. When you are doing constant GDP [on the other hand], it holds the prices constant. The only thing that changes is either the quantity or the quality.\" The World Bank also says that constant prices are adjusted for inflation and so measure true growth. Current prices aren't, and don't. In addition, how GDP is calculated has changed over time as the system of national accounts \u2013 internationally agreed standards for measuring economic activity \u2013 are reworked to cater for changes in the economy, Muchiri said. The key changes were in 1968, 1993 and 2008, when the current guidelines were established, he added. The World Bank data shows that Kenya's current price GDP grew from KSh6.6 billion in 1963 to KSh41 billion in 1978 when the senior Kenyatta died. In 2002, when Moi stepped down, it was KSh1.04 trillion, and KSh4.75 trillion in 2013, when Kibaki left office. But GDP for 1963 at constant prices comes to KSh371.9 billion. By the time Kenyatta took office in 2013, GDP when adjusted for inflation was KSh3.6 trillion. Kenya's GDP at start and end of presidential terms Year Current price GDP Constant price GDP 1963 KSh6.6 billion KSh371.9 billion 1978 KSh41 billion KSh998 billion 2002 KSh1.04 trillion KSh2.1 trillion 2013 KSh4.75 trillion KSh3.65 trillion The figures appear to swing wildly. This is to be expected. \"We must be very careful whenever we try to compare GDP across different years,\" Dr Abraham Rugo, the country manager of budget transparency think tank IBP Kenya, told Africa Check. In doing the maths, we have to consider inflation, currency valuation, population changes, technology and movements in the services sector across the years, he said. While Kenyatta's figure of KSh4.75 trillion for 2013 is accurate, it is not real growth. When adjusted for inflation, the actual GDP that year was about a quarter (23%) less. We therefore rate the president's claim as misleading. Kenyatta said the country's GDP was now KSh10.3 trillion. He gave 1885 as the year the country was colonised, making it 128 years from then until he took office in 2013. The most recent government data puts Kenya's GDP at KSh10.2 trillion in 2020. The World Bank's figure is slightly higher: KSh10.5 trillion in 2020. In 2013 GDP was KSh4.75 trillion, less than half of these figures. This seems to support Kenyatta's claim that GDP has doubled. But the claim faces the same comparison challenges discussed in the previous claim. The president's comparison was based on nominal, or current, values, John Mutua , the programmes coordinator at the Institute of Economic Affairs Kenya policy think tank, told Africa Check. But we can't directly compare GDP under Kenyatta with GDP under his predecessors, Mutua said. \"One has to factor inflation; there are issues of population growth and the likes. A comparison of just nominal figures is not accurate.\" The comparison also discounts the 2014 rebasing of GDP that, on paper, increased the size of the economy by 25%. (Read our analysis: The trouble with statistics in Africa .) GDP growth built from previous achievements A good indicator would be to use \"real\" GDP, which is adjusted for inflation, Mutua said. This was KSh5 trillion in 2019 according to data from Kenya's central bank . The most recent World Bank figure we found was also KSh5 trillion, but for 2020. The rise from KSh3.6 trillion, the real GDP in 2013, to KSh5 trillion in 2020 is not a doubling. On that score alone, the president is incorrect. Population size also matters when calculating GDP, IBP Kenya's Rugo told us. This is because household consumption is relevant. \"Does the government want to take credit for the annual rise in population numbers?\" he asked. Kenyatta's administration has invested heavily in major infrastructure such as rail , roads and energy , adding to the GDP, Rugo said. A lot of this is driven by debt, but does count when calculating GDP. Rugo also said that while Kenyatta's administration could lay claim to the infrastructure investments, a lot of the economic activity driving GDP growth today were put in place under his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki. \"GDP is incremental. You don't start from zero,\" he said. Kenya's constitution says the national government must share revenue with the country's 47 counties. It adds that this share must not be less than 15% of the last audited and approved national revenue. The counties also receive grants from the national government. Allocations to counties are set out in the law on division of revenue , which is approved every year. The table below shows the total allocation to counties since 2013. Allocation to Kenya's counties (2017 to 2020) Fiscal Year Amount (KSh billions) 2013/14 9.8 2013/14 210 2014/15 226.7 2015/16 287 2016/17 302.2 2017/18 345.7 2018/19 372.7 2019/20 378.5 2020/21 369.9 TOTAL 2,502.5 Source: Division of Revenue Acts The total is KSh2.5 trillion. The president understated it by KSh200 billion. Kenya's national treasury estimates GDP at the end of the 2019/20 financial year as KSh10.2 trillion , a\"preliminary actual\" figure. In his speech, the president said the most recent GDP figure was KSh10.3 trillion. From 2012/13 to 2020/21, county governments received a total of KSh2.5 trillion. This is equivalent to 24.5% of GDP, not 16.9% . On a \"pro-rata basis\", Kenyatta said , the 5.1 million title deeds to land issued under his administration were \"seven times what the previous administrations had done combined\". According to Kenya's lands ministry , the government has issued 5.1 million title deeds from 2013 to 2021. Six million were issued in the first 50 years of independence. In Kenyatta's first term, from 2013 to 2017, more than 3.21 million titles were issued, the ministry says . Over 1.26 million deeds were issued from 2018 to April 2020. Period Title deeds issued 2013 to 2017 3,218,170 2018 to April 2020 1,269,396 Total (2013 to April 2020) 4,487,566 Source: Ministry of Land and Physical Planning Africa Check previously asked the lands minister for data on title deeds issued since April 2020, but has not yet received a response. Based on the available data above, Kenyatta's claim that his administration has issued 5.1 million title deeds in seven years is mostly correct. This improved health infrastructure was an increase from only six renal units established under his three predecessors, Kenyatta said . Enquiries with the Renal Patients Society of Kenya and the Kenya Renal Association brought us to McDonald Ogutu, a researcher at the association. Ogutu told Africa Check that the association's database showed \"there are 212 renal units in Kenya at the moment, with 54 of them in public hospitals, while 158 are in private and faith based hospitals\". In March 2016, the health ministry reported that the president had pledged to distribute 289 dialysis machines to go with the 44 in place. The figure is in the president's state of the nation address of that year. A September 2020 senate report records that 305 additional dialysis machines were installed in 54 public health facilities during Kenyatta's tenure. Added to the 44, it brings the number to 349. We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct.",

        "doc": "Agano Party's David Mwaure forgot his history, but fared much better with his estimate of income tax. He however then tied himself in knots on foreign debt. Deputy President William Ruto of the United Democratic Alliance party was right about the cost of living and national debt . But he came a cropper on fuel taxes, youth unemployment and the number of accounts that creditors have blacklisted, among other claims. Only two of Kenya's four presidential candidates faced debate moderators, with only days to the country's much-anticipated 9 August general election. Deputy president William Ruto and David Waihiga Mwaure defended their public record and sought to explain their agenda should they be voted in. Former prime minister Raila Odinga was a no-show, having refused to share a platform with Ruto. Ruto and Odinga are the perceived frontrunners, according to opinion polls.  Lawyer George Luchiri Wajackoyah in turn walked out , having felt slighted at having to go before the pair in a separate debate. The organisers still proceeded to grill Ruto and Mwaure separately . Did the two candidates get their facts straight? ( Note: You can read our ' battle of the deputies ' fact-check of the running mates debates here .) Waihiga David Mwaure Asked why he believed he would win the presidency despite having failed with a 2017 bid to become the senator of Lamu county, Waihiga turned to former US president Abraham Lincoln for inspiration. \"One of the persons I have followed much is Abraham Lincoln. And if I remember my history right, it was during his 13th attempt \u2013 before that he had won some legislative positions \u2013 that he became the president of the United States,\" he said . We checked with the Library of Congress and found Lincoln won the US presidency on his first attempt. A timeline of his life shows that before this, he vied nine times for lower seats, winning five times, and losing on four occasions. Another timeline shows he lost his first attempt for a local legislative seat in 1832, but was elected four consecutive times to the Illinois general assembly. He was also elected once to the US house of representatives in 1846. He lost two bids for the US senate in 1855 and 1858 before becoming president in 1860. \u2014 Alphonce Shiundu PAYE, or \"pay as you earn\", is an income tax deducted from salaries. Waihiga promised to cut this by half should he win the presidency. This, he said, would put KSh230 billion (about US$1.9 billion) in the pockets of Kenyan citizens. Does Kenya's tax man collect that much as PAYE tax? On 7 July 2022, the Kenya Revenue Authority announced it had collected KSh461.8 billion as pay as you earn tax during the 2020/21 financial year. Despite being slightly off by KSh1.8 billion, Waihiga was on the money with this one. \u2013Tess Wandia Waihiga said that Kenya's foreign debt was at KSh1.3 billion. External debt is the total public and private debt that a country owes foreign creditors, experts have told Africa Check. It covers bilateral debt, multilateral debt and commercial debt. In its most recent economic review published in May 2022, Kenya's treasury said public debt was KSh8.4 trillion as of 31 March 2022, or $73.5 billion at current exchange rates. Data for the full 2021/22 financial year, which ended 30 June, is yet to be published. Of this KSh8.4 trillion, the total deb t from external sources was Ksh4.2 trillion or $36.6 billion . Of this, KSh1.17 trillion was bilateral debt, and KSh1.82 trillion was multilateral. Waihiga's estimate is grossly incorrect. \u2014 Dancan Bwire William Ruto The deputy president said \"five million young people are not working\". Kenya's constitution defines the youth as those aged between 18 to 34. The statistics office collects data on unemployment. Its most recent labour force report , published in May 2021, covers the first three months of that year. The report shows a total working-age population \u2013 those aged 15 to 64 - of 28 million people . There were about 11 million young people in the potential labour force, that is those willing and able to work. This figure includes those with and without jobs, and both available and unavailable job seekers. Of these, 9 million were employed. This leaves about 1.9 million without jobs. Only 959,889 were listed as unemployed because they had sought work and missed out. The report also showed that three million young people aged 15 to 34  \"were not in the education system and were not working or being trained for work\". Ruto's campaign recently sent us this table from the national statistics office showing that 5.1 million people were unemployed and underemployed. The table was published in 2018, with data from the 2015/16 integrated household budget survey. But the figure is for all Kenyans without jobs, not just young people. Those aged 15 to 34 then were about 3.5 million. The most recent publicly available data does not support Ruto's claim that five million young people have no jobs. \u2014 Dancan Bwire \"We have 15 million Kenyans who today are blacklisted in CRB,\" Ruto said . \"CRB\" stands for Credit Reference Bureaus. These are organisations that keep a record of borrower's loan history. Ruto's campaign recently told Africa Check that the figure of 14 million came from a February 2021 article in Kenya's Business Daily newspaper. This was after his number two, Rigathi Gachagua, claimed a figure of 14 million during the running mates debates . The central bank of Kenya has licensed three CRB firms: Metropol CRB , CreditInfo CRB ,and Transunion Kenya CRB . The article in question cited Metropol data as showing that \"the number of loans accounts in arrears for more than 90 days had jumped to 14,035,718 by January this year\". However, local television station KTN News debunked the claim. The station interviewed Sam Omukoko , Metropol's group managing director, who said the 14 million figure was the number of blacklisted accounts, not people. \"On average when you check through the bureau of records, Kenyans have an average of about five accounts, borrowing from banks, MFIs [and] saccos,\" Omukoko said in the 16 February 2022 interview. MFIs refers to microfinance institutions, while saccos are savings and credit societies. \"So you may find an account in the bank is in default but an account in the sacco is performing well or an MFI is performing well. So, that is the kind of thing that we are talking about. It was not about the number of people who have defaulted and been listed in the credit reference bureaus ,\" Omukoko said . He said the \"average default figure\" was three million, but did not specify if this referred to accounts or people. Africa Check has contacted Omukoko for clarification. In the meantime we rate Ruto's claim as incorrect. - Grace Gichuhi Ruto argued that an increase in food costs was the primary driver of the country's high cost of living. Every ten years the Kenya national data agency publishes a report on the  well-being of Kenyans. The most recent was published in March 2018 . It showed that from an average monthly expenditure of KSh7,311, Kenyans spent KSh4,239 on food. This works out to 54.3%. The rest is spent on non food items such as education, health, water, fuel, communication, entertainment and rent. The statistics bureau told Africa Check this was still the official figure. We therefore rate the claim mostly correct. \u2014Tess Wandia Ruto talked up his record as agriculture minister under president Mwai Kibaki . \"I am the minister who assembled the infrastructure that provided the subsidy on fertiliser, and we saw an increase of five million bags of maize when we rolled that plan,\" he said . Ruto was appointed agriculture minister in April 2008. A programme to subsidise the cost of fertiliser and seeds was already underway, having been launched in 2007. In February 2009, Ruto was presented with proposals to make fertiliser subsidies more effective. Kibaki announced subsidised fertiliser in March 2009 during Ruto's tenure. A year later, Ruto was transferred from the ministry. But did maize production jump by five million bags during his two-year stint? Data on maize production is found in the national statistics office's flagship annual economic survey. Maize production in Kenya from 2007 to 2011 Year No. of 90Kg bags Change in production 2007 32,500,000 2008 26,300,00 -6,200,000 2009 27,100,000 800,000 2010 35,800,000 8,700,000 2011 34,400,000 -1,400,000 Source: KNBS annual economic surveys 2011 and 2014 During Ruto's first year in office, production increased by 800,000 bags. Between 2009 and 2010, it increased by 8.7 million bags. Ruto is right that there was an increase during his tenure, but he understated the number by 3.7 million bags. We therefore rate this understated - he missed the chance to claim even more gains. \u2013Alphonce Shiundu Kenya's energy and petroleum regulator gives the maximum pump prices for petroleum products. These are enforced on the 15th of every month. Ruto said that \"almost 50%\" of the cost of fuel is attributable to taxes. The most recent pricing order was published on 14 July 2022. The breakdown of fuel prices, including taxes and levies are shown in the table below. Breakdown of Kenya fuel pricing components (14 July 2022) Summary Super (KSh/litre) Diesel (KSh/litre) Products costs 125.98 122.28 Distribution and storage costs 3.6 3.19 Margins 0.00 0.00 Price stabilisation deficit (34.52) (37.36) Taxes and levies 64.06 51.89 Applicable prices 159.12 140.00 Taxes and levies as share of the total price 40.3% 37% Source: Energy Petroleum Regulatory Authority The data shows taxes and levies account for between 37% and 40.3% of the total cost. We therefore rate the claim incorrect. \u2013Tess Wandia Ruto claimed there are 15 different taxes on fuel. In its most recent pricing directive , the energy regulator listed nine taxes and levies, and not 15. These are: Excise duty Road maintenance levy Petroleum development levy Petroleum regulatory levy Railway development levy Anti-adulteration levy Merchant shipping levy Import declaration fee Value-added tax (VAT) We rate the claim incorrect. \u2013 Tess Wandia Ruto claimed that during their first term, from 2013 to 2017, the Jubilee coalition administration which he was part of borrowed KSh2.2 trillion. We checked the public debt register and the annual debt reports that the treasury regularly submits to the national assembly . President Mwai Kibaki left office on 9 April 2013. Kenya's total public debt was then KSh1.89 trillion . The data shows that by the end of the 2016/17 financial year this had grown to KSh4.41 trillion. To triangulate this, the public debt register shows that by the end of the  2016/17 financial year public debt was KSh 4.19 trillion. ( Note: Kenya's financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June. ) Kenya's central bank also publishes monthly debt data . From April 2013 to August 2017, the government borrowed KSh 2.56 trillion. Kenya public debt from 2013 to 2017 Financial year Debt at end of the financial year (KSh trillion) Increase in public debt (KSh trillion) 2012/13 1.89 2013/14 2.42 0.53 2014/15 2.84 0.42 2015/16 3.61 0.77 2016/17 4.41 0.80 Total 2.52 Source: Annual debt reports from 2014/15 and 2019/20 The available data shows the Jubilee administration borrowed between KSh2.52 trillion and KSh2.56 trillion during Ruto's first term as deputy president . We rate the claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma Seeking to distance himself from recent borrowing, Ruto then said that \"...from 2017 our handshake brothers have borrowed KSh 4.2 trillion.\" The handshake truce between president Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga happened in 2018 . Prior to this the two had been political foes. Data from the national treasury for the 2019/20 financial year shows that by the end of 2017 debt was KSh4.41 trillion . By June 2021 it had swelled to KSh7.7 trillion. Public debt register data shows that by the end of the 2016/17 financial year  public debt was KSh4.20 trillion. The available information covers June 2021, when debt was KSh7.55 trillion. In its most recent quarterly economic and budgetary review report, published in May 2022, the treasury gave public debt as KSh8.4 trillion . Data for the full 2021/22 financial year, which ended 30 June, is yet to be published. Kenya's central bank data shows that by August 2017, the public debt was at KSh4.4 trillion, before growing to KSh8.2 trillion in December 2021. On 19 July the International Monetary Fund published a report on the state of the Kenyan economy. This put public debt at the end of the 2021/22 financial year at KSh9 trillion. Using all these sources of data, borrowing by the Jubilee government from 2017 to June 2022 - and of which Ruto was part of - adds up to at least KSh4.6 trillion. We rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2014Makinia Juma In its most recent quarterly economic and budget review published in May 2022, Kenya's treasury said public debt was KSh8.4 trillion (or $73.5 billion at the prevailing exchange rate) as of 31 March 2022. Data for the full 2021/22 financial year, which ended 30 June, is yet to be published. Of the KSh8.4 trillion, the data showed total debt from domestic sources was KSh4.19 trillion. The balance was marked as external debt. This is 49.9% of the total debt. Rounded off it comes to 50% - and not 80%. We rate Ruto's claim as incorrect. \u2013 Dancan Bwire",

        "doc": "Amidst unprecedented security measures , South Africa's President Jacob Zuma delivered his tenth State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2017. We fact-checked his speech . Energy Claim \"To date, nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have the electricity.\" Verdict correct South Africa's development indicators showed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further 233,455 were connected in 2014/15 and 231,012 were connected in 2015/16 . Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released. Zuma's claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016. As of 2016, 90,3% of South African households had access to electricity for lighting. - Kate Wilkinson Education Claim \"Among the participating countries [in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in mathematics and 90 points in science.\" Verdict correct The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science. Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested. The 2015 study found that South Africa's Grade 9 pupils recorded the \" biggest positive change \". There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics. The report goes on to note that \"South Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015\". While South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa's Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate Wilkinson READ: South African pupils not 'second worst in the world' in maths & science Claim \"Government also settled all debt owed by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students.\" Verdict misleading The media unit of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check to a lengthy statement issued by the scheme earlier this year . It stated that \"t he historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved\". However, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university. First, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students. South African students from the University of Cape Town listen to Western Cape premier Helen Zille during a meeting at the university in May 2011. Photo: AFP/GIANLUIGI GUERCIA\" /> \"Students who are still studying, dropped out or graduated within the stipulated academic years\" can have these loan payments effected, the NSFAS statement said. Second, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students' previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Third, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students' academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meet graduation requirements during their final year of study . Finally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or \"capital\" amount owed by the student to the university. Kagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students' historic debt. NSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand's NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that \"some outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS\". As such, the \"historical debt\" has not been \"settled\" but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading. - Vinayak Bhardwaj READ : FACTSHEET: Funding & the changing face of SA's public universities Claim \"A total of 173 inappropriate [schools] have been eradicated since 2011.\" Verdict correct The department of basic education replaces unsafe and \"inappropriate\" school structures under the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi) programme which started in 2011. As of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced, a department presentation to the select committee on basic education showed. At the time of Zuma's speech, the department's figures showed that 173 had been replaced . The latest figure displayed on the department's website puts the number of schools at 174. The programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially, 496 schools were identified as \"inappropriate structures\". Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14. - Kate Wilkinson Employment Claim \"In terms of the 2015 to 2016 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management levels amounted to 72%, while African representation was at 10%. The representation of coloureds stood at 4.5%, and Indians 8.7%.\" Verdict incorrect The commission for employment equity compiles an annual report on employment equity for the department of labour. The data in the report is submitted once a year by designated employers, which include employers who employ 50 or more employees, employers who employ fewer than 50 employees but have a certain annual turnover, as well as municipalities, all levels of government, state-owned companies and educational institutions. The 2015/16 annual report showed that 68.9% of top management workforce was white, 14.3% was black, 8.6% was Indian, 4.7% was coloured and 3.5% was foreign. The breakdown of management levels by population group: Top management Senior management Professionally qualified Skilled technical Black 14.3% 21.2% 41.2% 58.8% White 68.9% 58.1% 38.0% 22.0% Indian 8.6% 10.2% 8.5% 5.9% Coloured 4.7% 7.4% 9.4% 11.6% Foreign 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% 1.7% - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"The expanded public works program has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities towards the attainment of the target of 6 million work opportunities by the end of March 2019.\" Verdict correct Data from the expanded public works programme supports Zuma's claim. Nearly 2.5 million job opportunities were created between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. Total work opportunities 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 497,624 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 741,540 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 1,103,983 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 154,965 Total 2,498,112 Work opportunities are not permanent jobs, however, and in most cases only last a few months. The department of public works notes that \"the same individual can be employed on different projects and each period of employment will be counted as a work opportunity \". So while nearly 2.5 million work opportunities were created, this does not mean that the same number of people benefited from the programme. - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"Of the [more than 2 million] work opportunities created, more than 1 million have been taken up by the youth.\" Verdict correct This claim followed on from Zuma's previous statement, in which he said that \"the expanded public works programme has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities\". Africa Check was unable to find fourth quarter figures for 2013/14. However, even without them, the expanded public works programme reports show that 1,129,516 job opportunities were filled by young people. This was 45% of all work opportunities over the period. - Kate Wilkinson Total work opportunities for youth 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 222,587 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 340,663 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 566,265 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 - Total 1,129,516 Income inequality Claim \"White households earn at least 5 times more than black households, according to Statistics South Africa.\" Verdict mostly-correct Statistics South Africa's 2014/15 Living Conditions of Households Survey reported that black African households had an average income of R92,983 per year. In comparison, white households had an average income R444,446 per year. Based on these figures, white households' income is on average 4.8 times more than black households. - Kate Wilkinson Population Group Average annual household income Black R92,983 Coloured R172,765 Indian/Asian R271,621 White R444,446 National average R138,168 Economy Claim \"Only 10% of the top 100 companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are owned by black South Africans... according to the National Empowerment Fund.\" Verdict incorrect Zuma was wrong. In fact, his statement contained two errors. Top 17 financial services companies Africa Check asked the National Empowerment Fund (NEF), a government mandated fund tasked with facilitating economic equality and transformation in South Africa, for the research Zuma's claim was based on. They provided the organisation's 2017 submission to parliament's standing committee on finance. The research contained in the submission only looked at a \"sample analysis of the top 17 financial services companies by market capitalisation as listed on the JSE\" - not the top 100 companies, as Zuma held. The research refers to 31 December 2016 and was conducted by Intellidex , a South African capital markets and financial services research house. 10% = target The submission made no reference to black-ownership of the JSE equalling 10%. \"The study shows that the financial service sector companies have achieved an average of 6% against the direct equity target of 10%,\" the NEF told Africa Check. - Kate Wilkinson READ: Black ownership on SA's stock exchange - what we know Water Claim \"...about 10,000 unemployed youth are being trained as plumbers, artisans and water agents\" Verdict unproven In his 2015 State of the Nation Address, Zuma announced that 15,000 artisans, plumbers and water agents would be trained as part of the War on Leaks initiative. The department's 2015/2016 annual report noted that 3,000 artisans started training last year, while an additional 7,000 trainees were to join their ranks in August. The department's spokesman, Sputnik Ratau, was unable to confirm to Africa Check how many young people started training in August 2016. ( Note: We will update this report when Ratau supplies the figures for the second intake. ) However, he said the programme is still on-going and that a third intake of trainees would take place this year. - Gopolang Makou & Katleho Sekhotho READ: How many SA municipalities lose more than 37% of their water? We don't know Housing Claim \"Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than 4 million houses since 1994.\" Verdict incorrect Data from the department of human settlements shows that 2,835,275 houses were built by government between 1994/95 and 2013/14. A further 95,210 were built in 2014/15 and 100,339 were built in 2015/16 . This brings the total number of houses delivered to 3,030,824 - around a million less than Zuma claimed. It is possible that Zuma was referring to the delivery of both houses and serviced sites. This, however, is not a house. It is a piece of land, which should be supplied with water, electricity and sanitation, on which a recipient can build their own house. When serviced sites are included, the number of \"housing opportunities\" delivered rises to 4,060,795 as of 2015/16. However, concerns have been raised over the accuracy of the housing statistics. Experts caution that since the figures have not been independently verified they should be viewed as \" indicative rather than entirely conclusive \". - Kate Wilkinson FACTSHEET : The housing situation in South Africa Gender Claim \"At the level of gender, at senior management level males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4%.\" Verdict correct The commission for employment equity's 2015/16 annual report showed that 67.6% of employees at senior management were men and 32.4% of employees were women. - Kate Wilkinson Agriculture Claim \"There has also been a 19% decline in households involved in agriculture from 2.9 million in 2011 to 2.3 million households in 2016.\" Verdict correct The Agricultural Household section in Stats SA's 2016 Community Survey shows that households involved in agriculture decreased from 2.88 million in 2011 to 2.33 million in 2015. The statistical agency indicated that the drop can be attributed to the drought between 2014 and 2015. Using the unrounded figures, the drop is 17%, not 19%. - Gopolang Makou Tourism Claim \"O ur tourist arrival numbers for the period January to November 2016 increased to 9 million, an increase of just over 1 million arrivals from 2015. This represents a 13% growth in tourism arrivals.\" Verdict correct Statistics South Africa records the monthly tourist arrivals in South Africa. It downloads the data covering a specific calendar month from the department of home affairs. The total number of tourist arrivals between January and November 2016 adds up to 9 million, as Zuma stated.

The increase between 2015 and 2016 therefore is 13%. ( Note: Figures for December 2016 has since been released. With 965,107 tourist arrivals recorded, the total for 2016 is 10,044,163, compared to 8,903,773 in 2015 - also a 13% increase. ) However, arrivals in 2015 were much lower than the corresponding periods in 2014 and 2013, when more than 8.5 million tourists arrived between January and November in each year. - Vinayak Bhardwaj & Ziyanda Ngcobo Social grants Claim \"Social grants now reach close to 17 million people, mainly older persons and children\" Verdict downplayed Figures supplied to Africa Check by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), shows that the agency paid out more than 17 million grants at the end of January. Of those, 3,283,286 were recipients of the grant for older persons. By far the largest number of grants were for child support, with more than 12 million people receiving this type. - Julie Bourdin Grant type Number Old age grant 3,283,286 War veteran's grant 185 Disability grant 1,069,802 Grant in aid 159,515 Child support grant 12,039,444 Foster child grant 411,133 Care dependency grant 143,824 Total 17,094,331 Read: FACTSHEET: Social grants in South Africa \u2013 separating myth from reality Environment Claim \"We welcome the decline in rhino poaching incidents since October 2015 which is for the first time in a decade.\" Verdict unproven Consolidated figures for rhino poaching in 2016 have not yet been released. The latest figures were provided by the department of environmental affairs in a September 2016 media release . This was confirmed to Africa Check by departmental spokesman, Albi Modise. Between January and August 2016, 702 rhinos were poached countrywide, compared to 796 rhinos between January and July 2015 and a total of 1,175 rhino poaching incidents for the whole year, as recorded by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime . While this does indicate a decline in the incidents of poached rhino s (40 fewer incidents were recorded in 2015 than in 2014), this is a relatively small decline when compared to the steady increase in poaching incidents since 2008. Africa Check will only be able to verify this claim once the 2016 figures have been released. - Gopolang Makou Year Recorded incidents 2008 83 2009 122 2010 333 2011 448 2012 668 2013 1,004 2014 1,215 2015 1,175 Crime Claim \"Within the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit completed 389 forfeiture cases to the value of R349 million.\" Verdict correct Following a successful investigation or prosecution, the money that is recovered by the state from freezing orders is referred to as the value of \"completed forfeitures\". The National Prosecuting Authority's latest annual report shows that 389 forfeiture cases were completed by the Asset Forfeiture Unit during 2015/2016, like the president said. These completed cases were valued at R349.5 million, exceeding the R210 million that was projected to be recovered by R139.5 million. The annual report credits a focus on high-value cases, improved investigations and \"the increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture\" for the better-than-projected performance. The table below shows how the 2015/16 results compare to previous years: Financial year Value of completed forfeitures 2009/10 R185 million 2010/11 R212 million 2011/12 R164 million 2012/13 R119 million 2013/14 R296.4 million 2014/15 R1,939 million 2015/16 R349.5 million - Gopolang Makou Claim \"Last year, I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years.\" Verdict correct Zuma prefaced this claim by saying that collusion by cartels \"squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists\". It is likely that the president was referring to the proclamation signed in May last year which inserted section 73A into and amended section 74 of the existing Competition Act . The actual amendment act was passed by parliament in 2009, but various provisions of the amendment have been signed into effect periodically, director in the competition practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, Lara Granville , explained to Africa Check. This amendment act introduced provisions to deal with \"other practices that tend to prevent or distort competition in the market for any particular goods or services\", Granville said. Additionally, the act brings about provisions to hold personally accountable those individuals who \"cause firms to engage in cartel conduct\". The penalties for these offences are a fine \"not exceeding R500,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment\". However, the new penalties could deter people from coming forward with information about collusion, Granville said. \"While criminalisation may be an effective deterrent to cartel conduct, it may prevent people blowing the whistle about cartels to the competition tribunal due to fear of prosecution.\" - Vinayak Bhardwaj Claim \"Compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98%.\" Verdict correct Speaking about fighting crime, Zuma said one of government's strategies \"is to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again\". The department of correctional services' 2015/16 annual report shows that 51,307 of the 51,937 people (98.78%) released during that period complied with the conditions of their release. However, there are problems with this narrow reading of the figures, the director of the penal programme at the Lawyers for Human Rights , Clare Ballard, pointed out to Africa Check. \"The 'compliance' that the president refers to relates to policing aspects of parole,\" Ballard told Africa Check. That is, whether the parolee is at home when supposed to and whether the person is at home or work at a certain time, Ballard explained. The number doesn't capture opportunities to help parolees escape a life of crime, by receiving drug counselling or career advice. Furthermore, offenders serving life sentences experience significant delays in being granted parole, Ballard explained. South Africa introduced minimum mandatory sentences in 1997. In certain instances of rape and with certain types of murders the perpetrator must receive a sentence of life imprisonment, unless there are \"substantial and compelling circumstances\" that justify a lesser sentence. \"The department is clearly overwhelmed by the bottleneck that the minimum sentences have created,\" Ballard told Africa Check. Her calculations show that South Africa has more offenders serving life sentences than ever before. \"We represent hundreds of life offenders all over the country whose parole application processes have been delayed by years and years, simply because of systemic poor management of the process on the part of the parole boards, the national council of correctional services, and the minister, who has the final say on whether a life offender may be released,\" she added. - Vinayak Bhardwaj Health Claim \"The department of social development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities - in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, the Free State and Eastern Cape.\" Verdict correct The national drug master plan is South Africa's plan for reducing alcohol and substance abuse, spearheaded by the Central Drug Authority , the body responsible for its monitoring and implementation . According to the plan, the departments of social development and health will work together to provide inpatient treatment facilities at community and tertiary levels . In a 2016 parliamentary meeting , the deputy chairperson of the central drug authority, David Bayever, said that R150 million had been secured from treasury to build 4 public treatment centres in provinces that previously did not have these facilities: the Northern Cape, Free State, Limpopo (which, at the time, was completed but not functioning) and the Eastern Cape (which, at the time, was already functioning). National spokesman for the department of social development, Lumka Oliphant, told EWN and Africa Check that a treatment centre in the North West province has since been completed but that the centres in the Northern Cape, Free State as well as Limpopo (contradicting the parliamentary presentation) are still under construction. A year ago, the department said in a media statement that the Limpopo facility had already been completed. Africa Check called the Seshego Hospital near Polokwane, where the facility is situated and confirmed that the building has been erected but the centre is currently not operational. Africa Check also made calls to the centres in the North West (one located at the Taung Provincial Hospital and another located at the Witrand Psychiatric Hospital in Potchefstroom). From our calls, we gathered that the Witrand centre is currently open but the Taung facility is not yet operational. Further questions to Oliphant asking when these facilities were expected to be completed and operational were unanswered at the time of publication.

        "doc": "Under public pressure to rein in corruption, Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta promised an \"all-out assault\" as he delivered his sixth state of the nation address in April 2019. But as he listed the achievements of his administration in parliament , was he on target with his facts? We checked. The economy Claim \"Our broad-based economic growth averaged 5.6% over the last five years...\" Verdict correct In 2013, the year the president took office, the Kenyan economy grew 5.9%, and 5.4% in 2014, according to data from the national statistics office. The economic survey 2018 shows economic growth was 5.7% in 2015, 5.9% in 2016 and 4.9% in 2017. The average over those five years works out to 5.56%. We therefore rate the president's figure as correct. -Alphonce Shiundu Claim \"... outperforming the average global growth.\" Verdict misleading Kenyatta said the rate the Kenyan economy grew at had outpaced the world. According to the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook update in January 2019, the world economy grew 3.7% in 2018, a slight dip from 3.8% in 2017. Additional data shows global growth was 3.2% in both 2015 and 2016, and 3.4% in 2014. In 2013 this was 3.2% . This averages to 3.36% between 2013 and 2017, which is well under Kenya's growth that same period. The figures appear to bear the president out. But there's more. Is Kenya doing better than the rest of the world? We asked Kwame Owino, the chief executive of think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, Kenya for context. 'Compare ourselves with our peers' The numbers are expected, Kwame said. This is because mature economies grow at a slower rate, having exhausted the capital and gains they can get from technology. But the US with 2% growth still created significantly more wealth than Kenya did with a 5.6% growth rate. Kenya therefore needed to grow even faster to close the public welfare gap, Kwame said. But the broader comparison distorts the picture. \"It is misleading. We should compare our growth rates with our peers, people within our range,\" Kwame said. For instance, according to World Bank data , in eastern Africa, over the last five years, Kenya's economy has been growing faster than Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, but slower compared to Tanzania and Ethiopia. Claim \"In 2018, provisional estimates show the economy grew by 6.1%.\" Verdict mostly-correct Kenya's statistics agency expects the economy to grow 6% in 2018. This is according to the national treasury's budget policy statement . The economy grew 5.8% in the first three months of 2018, 6.2% in the second quarter and 6% in the third quarter of the year. This, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said, was due to \"favourable weather conditions and a stable macroeconomic environment\". The Parliamentary Budget Office \u2013 a non-partisan office that advises lawmakers on the economy - mirrored this forecast in March 2019. In a forecast the same month, the World Bank predicted 5.8% growth for the year. This would be due to \"recovery in agriculture, better business sentiment, and easing of political uncertainty\". For the economy to grow at 6.1%, growth for the last quarter will need to come in at 6.4%. But given the proximity of the other forecasts to the president's figure, which he noted was provisional, we rate this claim as mostly correct. - Alphonce Shiundu Power Claim \"We have made tremendous gains\u2026 over the last six years, with the number of electricity connections rising from 2.2 million in March 2013 to 7.1 million as at March 2019.\" Verdict mostly-correct The text of the president's speech gave the number of connections as 2.264 million in March 2013 and 7.029 million in March 2019. But when he spoke he said \"2.2 million\" and \"7.1 million\". National utility Kenya Power 's 2018 annual report says it had an estimated 6.76 million customers connected to electricity. An earlier report says there were 2.33 million customers at the end of June 2013. Kevin Sang, a spokesperson for Kenya power, told Africa Check the latest figures were 7 million customers connected to power. What the president actually said is therefore mostly correct -Alphonce Shiundu. Claim \"Installed capacity has increased from 1,768 MW in March 2013 to the current 2,712 MW.\" Verdict correct Kenyatta said clean energy plants had helped increase capacity, with wind projects in Lake Turkana and Ngong and a solar project in Garissa joining the grid in 2018. The energy regulatory commission puts Kenya's installed capacity in June 2013 at 1,765 MW. By June 2018 it had risen to 2,351 MW, according to data from Kenya Power . (Note: Installed capacity is the capacity of all the power plants if they run at 100%. Effective capacity is the actual available power.) \"According to our latest figures, the installed capacity is now 2,712 MW, while the effective capacity is 2,638 MW,\" Kenya Power spokesperson Kevin Sang told Africa Check on 5 April 2019, the day after Kenyatta's State of the Nation Address.We therefore rate the claim as correct. -Alphonce Shiundu County funding Claim \"Since April 2013, more than KSh1.7 trillion shillings has been transferred to the counties.\" Verdict incorrect In 2010, a new constitution provided for the creation of 47 county governments. The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. The Division of Revenue Acts show the total allocations to county governments were KSh 1.76 trillion. However, not all this money was actually transferred. The sums actually sent to the counties are captured by the office of the controller of budget . The treasury releases money to the county governments' accounts, but the controller of budget then finalises the transfer by allowing the counties to access the money. Amounts to Kenya counties 2013-2019 (billions of shillings) Year Total Allocation Treasury transfers to counties Approved by budget office 2013/2014 210 195.7 174.4 2014/2015 242.36 231.06 228.53 2015/2016 287.04 276.22 303.47 2016/2017 302.2 305.02 328.24 2017/2018 345.69 326.9 324.12 2018/2019* 372.74 177.31* 145.11** TOTAL 1760.03 1512.22 1503.87 SOURCE: TREASURY, CONTROLLER OF BUDGET, PARLIAMENT * As of 28 February 2019 . **Budget office, half-year 2018/19 The amount transferred to the counties as per the latest available figure is KSh1,503.87. The president's amount is thus off by KSh190 billion. We therefore rate the claim incorrect. -Vincent Ng'ethe READ MORE : How Kenyatta mangled his numbers on Kenyan counties' development spend Education Claim \"Our aggressive push of this [universal access to basic education] agenda has this year seen us achieve 100% transition rate.\" Verdict incorrect This claim stems from a 2017 campaign promise to achieve a 100% transition rate from primary to secondary school by providing free secondary education . According to the economic survey 2018, the transition rate in 2017 was 83.1%. A recent education ministry report puts the rate at 93.14% on 22 February 2019. In March Amina Mohammed, then the cabinet secretary for education, tweeted that the transition rate was \"93% and rising\". The rise from 83.1% to 93.14% can be attributed to the free-day high school subsidy, and the work of provincial administration \u2013 chiefs and their assistants \u2013 to ensure all students who sit their final primary school exam get into secondary school. This is according to Amos Kaburu from Uwezo , a literacy and numeracy programme at Twaweza East Africa . Dr John Mugo, who has researched education in Kenya , said that while the transition rate had risen, it was unlikely to have reached 100%. First, he said, secondary education is not fully compulsory, as no law forced parents to ensure their children go to high school. It's also not completely free. There are still direct costs such as for uniforms, transport and food. And the opportunity cost \u2013 the loss of possible income and domestic labour provided by children \u2013 is not considered. Providing free tuition without also giving legislative and other support to parents in different social contexts would not guarantee a 100% transition rate, Mugo told Africa Check. -Alphonce Shiundu Transport Claim \"2.5 million passengers have travelled using Madaraka Express since its inception in May 2018.\" Verdict correct The president flagged off the maiden passenger train on the standard gauge railway in May 2017 , not May 2018 as in his speech. In 2017, some 699,055 passengers travelled on the train, according to December 2018 economic data from the national statistics agency .They brought in receipts of KSh627 million. In 2018, revised official data showed that the train carried 1,665,627 passengers, bringing in KSh1.6 billion in revenue. This, Rosemary Bowen, an official with the statistics agency, told Africa Check. The first two months of 2019 recorded 226,027 passengers. Since its launch in May 2018 the train has carried 2,590,709 passengers and earned revenue of KSh2.5 billion. This number of passengers also counts repeat passengers, Bowen said. \"It is not unique passengers.\" In November 2018, a passenger recognised as the two millionth passenger said she was a frequent user of the service. - Vincent Ng'ethe Claim \"Since its inception 3.881 million tonnes of cargo have been transported on the standard-gauge railway line.\" Verdict mostly-correct Data from the national bureau of statistics showed that 5 million tonnes of cargo had been moved by December 2018 - about 1.1 million tonnes of cargo more than the President stated. We asked about the discrepancy. The agency said the data had been revised. Transportation of cargo did not start until January 2018 . That year, the cargo service moved 2.9 million tonnes, earning revenue of KSh4.1 billion. In the first two months of 2019 some 662,419 tonnes of cargo were transported. This brought the total to 3.6 million tonnes. With March 2019 not accounted for, we rate the president's number of 3.8 million tonnes as mostly correct. - Vincent Ng'ethe Housing Claim \"Over 175,000 Kenyans have already registered under the voluntary scheme known as 'boma yangu.\" Verdict mostly-correct Providing affordable housing is a key priority for Kenyatta's legacy. As part of this, the president noted that more than 175,000 Kenyans have registered for a plan to allocate houses. Citizens are first required to sign up through a portal at no cost . This then allows them and their employers to contribute some of their income, up to a maximum of KSh2,500 a month. There's also a voluntary contribution that is not capped. When the building of houses starts, the applicants will through a \"regular, fair and transparent system free of any human intervention and contact\" be allocated houses. This will depend on a number of factors such as when they listed, \"family status as well as demand across the housing categories\". As of 4 April 2019 there were 186,256 registered applicants. While this is 11,000 more people, it is \"over 175,000\". The president actually missed the chance to announce a larger figure. - Alphonce Shiundu READ MORE : 500,000 or 200,000? President's numbers for mortgages in Kenya both wide of the mark Small businesses Claim \"The micro, small and medium enterprises sector employs approximately 14.9 million Kenyans.\" Verdict correct According to the 2016 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Survey , MSMEs as they are known are enterprises \"having between 1 and 99 employees\". Micro-enterprises have less than 10 employees; small enterprises have between 10 and 49 employees while medium-sized enterprises have between 50 to 99 employees. The survey, from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , showed these businesses employ 14, 898,300 people. Some 42.2% of the businesses were licensed while 57.8% were unlicensed. The president's claim is correct based on the most recently available public data. - Vincent Ng'ethe Note: We are still checking more claims ranging from energy to agriculture and education.

        "doc": "In any debate, Africa Check verifies statements of fact, not opinions. Whether there has been \"spectacular\" racial transformation in South Africa - as Leon Louw from the Free Market Foundation has argued - falls outside Africa Check's remit. Our goal is to keep debate honest by reviewing the evidence an argument is built on. Africa Check also aims to fact-check both sides of a dispute. For example, former Economic Freedom Fighters member of parliament, Andile Mngxitama, stated earlier this year: \"Whites are only 10% of the economically active population but occupy more than 60% of the top management positions.\" Louw wrote: \"Blacks in top management... doubled.\" Who's right? Both - by presenting only a specific slice of the data. We accept that by analysing the evidence we won't convince everyone . Mngxitama and Louw were both harsh in their reaction to our fact-checks. In a thinly veiled reference to Africa Check, Louw suggested in a column that we were racist for finding fault with some of the facts he cited, while Mngxitama claimed we have a \"racist ideology\". It seems Mngxitama and Louw share common ground after all. Also read: Claims of South Africa's 'spectacular transformation' fact-checked Black middle class Claim \"The black middle class grew 333% from 1.8 million to 6 million.\" Verdict incorrect The source Louw provided was a study carried out by the University of Cape Town's Unilever institute of strategic marketing called \" Four Million and Rising \". It stated that South Africa's black middle class grew from 1.7 million in 2004 to 4.2 million in 2012 - a 147% increase over that period. According to the institute's management consultant, Paul Egan, someone qualified as middle class if they were older than 18 and lived in a household with an income of between R16,000 and R50,000 per month at the time of the study. Two of the following criteria also had to be met: own a car, have tertiary education or be studying, work in a professional job, live in formal housing in a metropolitan area or pay rent of R4,000 or more. Since then, the institute has not conducted any further research on the middle class in South Africa. That said, different studies employing different methods have come up with different figures. For instance, according to a Stellenbosch University study the black middle class totalled nearly 3 million people in 2012, using a cut-off of per capita income of R25,000 per year in 2000 prices. A 2015 journal article calculated the black middle class to have increased from 7.7 million individuals in 1993 to 10.4 million in 2008 (up 35%), when an after-tax income bracket of R1,400 to R10,000 per capita per month in 2008 prices was applied. The author, Justin Visagie, wrote: \"In sum, the racial composition of the middle class and upper class displayed massive transformation between 1993 and 2008... That said, there is still significant progress to be made.\" Definitions and estimates of the black middle class vary, but the source Louw provided did not support his claim. Income Claim \"Between 1996 and 2011 total black disposable income grew 370% from R161 million to R756 million.\" Verdict unproven Louw cited articles by the Helen Suzman Foundation as the source for his claim, but these did not substantiate his figures. Africa Check phoned the writer of the articles, economist Charles Simkins, who extracted data from the 2001 and 2011 Census, saying it showed that total black disposable income increased from R16.9 billion in 2001 to R60.4 billion in 2011, a 257% increase. (Simkins said 1996 data on disposable income is unavailable.) However, researcher and PhD student at Stellenbosch University, Asmus Zoch, said that the census data does not provide an accurate total, because the top income bracket by which a household head can report disposable income is open-ended. Zoch stressed that researchers should control for both inflation and population increases over long time periods. \"This gives a better idea about the wealth changes than [combined] numbers, especially if the total black population is growing,\" he told Africa Check. Converting data from the Project for Statistics on Living Standards and Development , collected in 1993/94, and 2012 data from the National Income Dynamics Study into constant 2000 prices, Zoch calculated that black per capita household income increased from R363 in 1994 to R775 in 2012, a 114% increase. Claim \"Between 1996 and 2011\u2026 personal income grew 300%.\" Verdict unproven Africa Check was unable to source data for the specific years mentioned. However, data for a similar timespan is available in a paper called \" Trends in South African Income Distribution and Poverty since the Fall of Apartheid \" by economists the University of Cape Town's Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU). Per capita annual personal income in 2000 prices increased by only 93% for black people between 1993 and 2008, from R5,073 to R9,790. (For white people, the increase was 62%, from R46,486 to R75,297.) Former white areas Claim \"There are more middle class blacks in formerly white suburbs than the entire white population.\" Verdict unproven Louw provided a slide from a presentation by WHAM! Media , a social investment communications company, as his source. It showed these figures for the \"new black middle class\", taken in turn from the Newspaper Advertising Bureau : Polokwane 30% to 64% Midrand 53% to 62% Kempton Park 33% to 50% Centurion 14% to 43% Durban Berea 33% to 53% Louw told Africa Check his claim was \"extrapolated\" from the slide's figures, but he did not explain how he used five data points to make a national claim. The Newspaper Advertising Bureau publishes what it calls \"South Africa's largest urban, community level quantitative survey\", called Roots. The most recent edition on their website, Roots 2013 , includes demographic and socio-economic data collected from 115 suburbs and towns in South Africa. Samu Makhatini, research manager at SPARK Media of which the bureau forms part of, told Africa Check that, very much like with the first claim, it would depend on how one defines the black middle class. She said it was possible to cross-tabulate data from their research but she was unable to confirm whether it was carried out correctly without seeing how exactly it was done. Africa Check also contacted Statistics South Africa to ask if the claim could be verified using their data. Living conditions survey manager, Patricia Koka, said data published from the Income and Expenditure Surveys and the Living Conditions Survey can be reported at provincial level and other categories like population group, settlement type and sex, but that data cannot be disaggregated into suburbs. Top management Claim \"Blacks in top management... doubled\" [presumably from 2000 to the present] Verdict mostly-correct Louw did not provide evidence to support this claim. A report by the Commission for Employment Equity for 1999 to 2001 showed that 87% of top managers were then white, 6% were African/black, 4% were Indian and 3% coloured. The commission's latest report for 2014/15 showed that the share of African/black people in top management positions was 13.6%, a 127% increase. White South Africans held 70% of top management positions in 2014/15. Important to note though, is submissions from designated employers for 2014/15 only accounted for 7 million employees out of the 20.3 million people in South Africa's economically active segment. Literacy Claim \"Black literacy is up 50% since 1994.\" Verdict incorrect Louw did not provide a source to support this claim. In 1994, 67.4% of African/black people were \"functionally literate\", Dr Anne Harley, from the University of KwaZulu Natal's Centre for Adult Education , and other researchers determined from Stats SA's 1994 October household survey . This refers to people who have completed at least Grade 7 of schooling. However, Stats SA service delivery statistics manager, Ni\u00ebl Roux, told Africa Check that the \"sample and fieldwork execution used in 1994 were much more rudimentary as a result of the shortage of recent census data which could have informed the sample frame that was used\". As a result, Roux said this data was less reliable. He directed Africa Check to the 1996 census, which estimated that 59.3% of African/black people aged 15 and older were functionally literate then. By last year, it was estimated to have increased to 82.8% \u2013 or up 40% since 1996. Life expectancy Claim \"Black life expectancy defied AIDS and rose from age 53 to 60 in five years between 2006 and 2011.\" Verdict mostly-correct Stats SA's 2015 mid-year population estimates reported that life expectancy increased from 55.3 years in 2006 to 59.7 years in 2011 for all South Africans. In 2015 it stood at 62.5 years. Manager for demographic analysis at Stats SA, Diego Iturralde, told Africa Check that \"life expectancy for race groups isn't published\" by the organisation. He was however able to extract data which showed that black life expectancy increased from 51.5 years in 2006 to 57.2 years in 2011. Education Claim \"Private schools are 72% black.\" Verdict incorrect To support this claim, Louw provided a report containing the claim but no source. South Africa's department of basic education sent Africa Check a racial breakdown of students at independent schools in South Africa from Pre-Grade R to Matric. The data showed that in 2014, 65% of students were African/black, 22% were white, 7% were Indian/Asian, 5% were coloured and the race of 2% were not determined. Claim \"...blacks have more than half of all degrees.\" Verdict correct Louw's statement was ambiguous. It only became clear that he was referring to the share of degrees awarded per year as we started tracking down the original source of his claim. This is true \u2013 of the 164,423 degrees awarded to South Africans studying at public universities last year, 105,782 (64%) were conferred to African/black students. Share of ownership Claim : \"Blacks are approaching or have surpassed 50% in almost everything\u2026\" 1) Shares Verdict: Incorrect Louw told Africa Check that the source of the statistic was a \"media briefing document\" from economist Vivian Atud. However, when Africa Check contacted Atud she said that the research she conducted showed that 23.4% of shares were black-owned. None of the available research on share ownership of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) supports Louw's claim. Research conducted for the JSE in 2013 estimated that 10% of shares were directly owned by black people (\"largely through BEE schemes\") and 13% were held indirectly by black people (\"mostly through individuals contributing to pension funds, unit trusts and life policies\"). The JSE has not released any subsequent research. That same year the National Empowerment Fund estimated that black people controlled just 3% of companies on the JSE. Their latest estimate, from May 2017, is still 3%. Read our guide to the different methodologies that produced these estimates. 2) New companies Verdict : Unable to verify In support of this claim, Louw provided a link to the April 2014 archive of ZAeconomist.com , which describes itself as \"a blog on the South African economy and its financial markets.\" However, the April 2014 blog posts did not include any information on the percentage of new companies that were black owned. Data manager at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission , Marietjie Swart, told Africa Check that 248,902 new companies were registered in 2014. However, she said that the commission does not \"record the race of directors of companies\". Because of this, the commission is unable to provide a racial breakdown of company ownership in South Africa. 3) Insurance policies Verdict: Unable to verify Louw cited Vivian Atud, who was previously an economist at the Free Market Foundation, as the source of this claim. Atud told Africa Check that she had conducted research on racial ownership of companies in 2010 but she did not respond to Africa Check's request for the research. The South African Insurance Association told Africa Check that most insurers \"do not request the race of the policy holder to be disclosed\". Social grants Claim \"The welfare budget exploded from R10 billion to R100 billion between 1994 and 2011.\" Verdict mostly-correct According to South Africa's 2012 National Development Indicators , social assistance expenditure \"increased from R10 billion in 1994 to just under R100 billion in 2011/12 and constitutes 3.4% of GDP\". A South African Reserve Bank report specifies the amount for 2011/12 as R96 billion. To compensate for inflation, Professor Ingrid Woolard of the School of Economics at UCT, who specialises in researching social protection and poverty and inequality, calculated the increase in real terms. Using Stats SA's Consumer Price Index figures , Woolard said that the 2011/12 amount of R96 billion would equate to R34 billion in 1994 terms. Alternatively, the 1994 amount of R10 billion would be equivalent to R29 billion in 2011 prices. Also read: FACTSHEET: Social grants in South Africa \u2013 separating myth from reality Poverty Claim \"Blacks living on less than $2 a day fell from 16% to 2.5% since 1996.\" Verdict incorrect Africa Check was first directed by Louw to page 175 of the Presidency's Twenty Year Review . But that page noted that the share of all people in South Africa living on less than $2.50 a day fell from 42.4% in 2000 to 29.2% in 2011. A second source, a presentation by WHAM! Media's editor-in-chief Paul Pereira, claimed that the percentage of all people living on $2 a day fell from 16% in 1996 to 2.7% in 2009. Pereira told Africa Check there was an error in the slide and that the 2.7% estimate referred to 2011, not 2009. He said the data was sourced from the South African Institute Of Race Relations' 2012 South Africa Survey which had in turn sourced the data from IHS Global Insight Southern Africa . Gerhard Bijker, country manager for South Africa at IHS, told Africa Check that IHS stopped calculating what percentage of people were living on less than $2 a day when Stats SA published a set of three national poverty lines in 2012. \"Now [Stats SA] has the food poverty line and the upper bound and lower bound [poverty line] and those are the ones that are better to use,\" Bijker said. Africa Check then consulted three further sources, none of which supported Louw's claim: Additional Reading Race, poverty and inequality: Black First Land First claims fact-checked COMMENT: Where's the evidence for the Free Market Foundation's 'facts'?

        "doc": "President Jacob Zuma's government has done \"a good job of stabilising the economy and investing in infrastructure to propel the economy into the next phase of growth, while investing in improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable\". This is one of the central claims made by Jeff Radebe \u2013 the Minister in the Presidency responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation \u2013 in a lengthy article defending the president's performance. It followed an attempt by an opposition party to introduce a motion of no confidence against Zuma. Radebe listed a number of achievements he attributed to the Zuma and the government. \"This is not a political stunt,\" he wrote, \"this is no fiction; this is reality.\" Are his statements based on reality? Africa Check assessed them. (Note: Radebe's office failed to respond to several requests for the source material on which he based his claims. A government spokesperson, Phumla Williams, also ignored calls and text messages. We have evaluated the claims by drawing on publicly available data and information.) Voting Claim \"In 2014, more than 62% of South Africans made their democratic choice to choose a political party of their choice.\" Verdict incorrect South Africa had a population of around 54-million people in 2014. According to the Independent Electoral Commission , an estimated 31.4-million people were eligible to vote in 2014 but only about 18.4-million people turned up to vote. The ANC garnered 11.4-million votes . This means that 21% of all South Africans, or 36% of all eligible voters, voted for the ANC. Sixty two percent of all valid votes cast were for the African National Congress. Economic growth Claim \"By the fourth quarter of 2014, GDP showed signs of recovery at a 4.1%. What is important, though, is that the real sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, were positive and actually grew.\" Verdict misleading Radebe is right on the numbers, but the financial quarter he chose to highlight paints a much brighter economic picture than is actually the case. The deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Francois Groepe, made the distinction in a recent address : \"Although the South African economy expanded at a brisk annualised rate of 4.1% in the final quarter of 2014, growth for the full year was a disappointing 1.5% and represents the second-lowest growth rate recorded over the past sixteen years.\" If you look at 2014 as a whole , the mining sector actually contracted by 1.6%, while the manufacturing industry showed no growth. Agriculture did increase by 5.6% percent. Employment Claim \"Whilst jobs were lost [due to the recession], in 2014 South Africa has actually managed to employ even more people than were employed in the years when jobs were lost, implying that there is recovery.\" Verdict misleading Radebe's claim only deals with absolute labour statistics, that is, the actual number of people employed. In the fourth quarter of 2008 there were approximately 14.7-million people employed in the South African economy. By the third quarter of 2010 1.1-million jobs had been lost. Since then employment has increased. The most recent employment statistics show that 15.3-million people were employed in the fourth quarter of 2014 . However, Radebe's claim is misleading in that the unemployment rate has not recovered to pre-recession levels. Ratios are a better measure than absolute figures, the executive manager of labour statistics at Stats SA, Peter Buwembo, has told Africa Check. Prior to the recession the narrow unemployment rate was 21.5%. The latest statistics show the unemployment rate was 24.3% at the end of 2014. Renewable energy Claim \"Under the stewardship of President Zuma, South Africa has one of the largest renewable energy programmes ranked among the top 10 in the world.\" Verdict incorrect According to Kadri Nassiep, CEO of the state-owned South African National Energy Development Institute , \"countries such as China, US and Germany still lead the way in total installed capacity\". He added that South Africa falls in the top 5 countries when the size of its renewable energy investment is compared to GDP. Uruguay, Mauritius and Costa Rica topped this ranking in the 2014 Global Status Report, compiled by international renewable network REN21. South Africa did make the top 10 list for investment in renewable energy in 2012 and 2013. The two most recent reports by Bloomberg New Energy Finance stated that South Africa invested $5.7-billion in renewable energy in 2012 and $4.9-billion in 2013 . China was head and shoulders above the rest: investing $64.7-billion and $54.2-billion in those years. It already has an installed renewable energy capacity of 378GW , whereas South Africa aims for 6.7GW by 2016 and 17.8GW by 2030 . Electricity Claim \"The percentage of households connected to the electricity mains increased from 82% to 85%.\" Verdict correct The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of households connect to electricity mains increased from 82.7% in 2009 to 85.4% in 2013. The statistics for 2014 will be released around the middle of this year. Water Claim \"The percentage of households connected to piped water increased from 88% to 90%.\" Verdict mostly-correct The 2013 General Household Survey revealed that 89.9% of households had access to piped water, up from 89% when Zuma took office. Just over 4% of households had to fetch water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools and dams, wells and springs. But this one statistic does not provide the full picture about access to water in South Africa. In 2013 a quarter of households reported interruptions to their water supply that lasted more than 2 days at a time or lasted more than 15 days in total. Households also reported problems with the quality of water they received. In 2013 7.4% households (1.1-million) felt that their water was not safe to drink, 7.9% that their water was not clear, 8.8% that their water did not taste good whereas just over a million households (6.9%) felt that their water was not free from bad smells. Sanitation Claim \"The percentage of households with access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 70% to 78%.\" Verdict mostly-correct The 2013 General Household Survey showed that access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 72.4% of households in 2009 to 77.9% of households in 2013. RDP standard sanitation includes flush toilets (either connected to a public sewerage system or a septic tank) or a pit toilet with a ventilation pipe. In 2013 62% percent of households had access to a flush toilet connected to either the public sewerage system or a septic tank. 15% has access to a pit latrine with a ventilation pipe and 16% has access to a pit latrine without a ventilation pipe. Four percent of households reported that they did not have access to sanitation of any kind. The survey noted that \"the percentage of households that continued to live without proper sanitation facilities had been declining consistently between 2002 and 2013\". However, the general secretary of the Cape Town based Social Justice Coalition, Phumeza Mlungwana, told Africa Check that Radebe's numbers lacked important context. \"The claim doesn't say anything about the condition of the toilet or the experience of using it or whether the toilet is functional and clean,\" she said. For the first time, the 2013 General Household Survey included questions about problems experienced by households that share sanitation facilities. Statistics provided by Stats SA showed that 3,209,048 households (22.4%) reported sharing toilets facilities. The main problems these households experienced included poor hygiene (25.6%), poor lighting (25.1%), concern about physical safety while using the toilets (22%) and finding the toilet pit or chamber full (21.8%). Education Claim \"The percentage of persons aged 20 years and above with no formal education or highest level of education less than Grade 7 within each gender group decreased from 19.3% to 16.2%.\" Verdict correct The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of people aged 20 years and older who had no education, or had completed some primary school below grade 7, had decreased from 19.3% in 2009 to 16.2% in 2013. Life expectancy Claim \"South Africans now live nine years longer than they did in 2005 due to the roll-out by this government of drugs that prolong life.\" Verdict correct Radebe's claim is supported by Stats SA's 2014 mid-year population estimates . It showed that life expectancy increased by 9.1 years from 52.1 in 2005 to 61.2 years in 2014. Deputy executive director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute , Francois Venter, told Africa Check that the general consensus was that life expectancy in South Africa had been driven up by the rollout of antiretroviral therapy. \"If you stop someone from dying in their 20s, 30s and 40s with ARVs, you bump up the average age at death significantly,\" he said. \"It is possible other things contributed \u2013 fresh water, less under-nutrition, expanded vaccine programmes \u2013 but that doesn't cause such a dramatic change.\" Student aid Claim \"[The] National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) increased from R2.4 billion in 2008 to R9.5 billion in 2014.\" Verdict mostly-correct The National Student Financial Aid Scheme's annual reports show that they provided funding worth R2.5-billion in 2008/09 . A spokesman for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, Kagisho Mamabolo, told Africa Check that R9.2-billion worth of funding was provided in 2014. However, this excluded an additional R1-billion which was provided by the Department of Higher Education and Training to cover funding shortfalls in 2013 and 2014. The scheme provides funding to students that qualify according to a financial means test . Students are required to start repaying their loans once they start earning a salary of R30,000 or more per year, at an initial rate of 3% of their annual salary. Both students and universities have raised concerns that there is not enough funding to assist financially needy students. Earlier this year Wits University's Student Representative Council was reported to have raised R2-million to assist students that did not receive funding from the scheme. Poverty Claim \"South Africans benefit from a cocktail of social assistance programmes and services that alleviate poverty and indeed poverty has visibly been reduced since 2000.\" Verdict correct Research by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit at the University of Cape Town, among others, showed that poverty as measured by income declined slightly between 1993 and 2012. To a large degree, the decline could be attributed to state spending on social grants, said Lauren Royston, director of research and capacity at the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI). Another tool whereby poverty can be measured showed an even greater reduction over this period . The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) takes into account more than income. It scores nine factors, such as school enrolment, nutritional levels and access to basic services that include electricity, sanitation and water. However, the index suffers from two limitations, former SERI researcher Michael Clark pointed out. First, it relies heavily on government statistics. The index also does not measure the quality of basic services. Despite the decrease achieved, Royston said South Africans must be mindful that poverty remains deep and widespread and that inequality has increased . State spending Claim \"South Africans have continued to trust government with their taxes. South Africa's budget in 1994 was R135.1-billion; by 2004 this had doubled to R370-billion and R834-billion in 2009. The Minister of Finance recently announced a budget of R1.3-trillion. This means that since 2009 we have added more than the equivalent of the entire budget of 2004 and seen a 1,000% increase since 1994.\" Verdict incorrect This claim is a bit nonsensical as it neither proves nor confirms anything, said the head of Wits University's School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw. \"One, we are compelled to pay taxes and two, to judge the budget in nominal terms doesn't tell us much.\" Rossouw said a more useful metric is to compare the budget with the gross national product (GDP) in a particular year. South Africa's budget comprised 28.9% of GDP in the 1992/93 financial year , the highest this ratio was from 1993 to 2012. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12 it averaged 27.2%. In 2013 the ratio reached 33.2% . There is a cause for concern when state expenditure grows faster than the economy, said Rossouw, as he has pointed out as co-author of a journal article before . However, state expenditure slowed in the fourth quarter of last year , giving some credence to the state's promise to curb spending.",

        "doc": "The Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa's official opposition party, rules 26 municipalities in South Africa. They are aiming to add municipalities like Nelson Mandela Bay, Tshwane and Tlokwe to the list in the upcoming local government election. Their 68-page manifesto is titled \"Change that moves South Africa forward again\". In the first pages, DA leader Mmusi Maimane spells out the DA's vision for local government saying that \"this document does not only make promises of a better future, it illustrates the progress we have already made in the municipalities we currently govern\". Here we evaluate are key claims in the DA's manifesto about their past performance in local government. ( Note: We aren't able to fact-check promises but will keep an eye on whether they are fulfilled .) We have also fact-checked the manifestos of the African National Congress and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF): Is the ANC 'advancing people's power'? We fact-check key election claims Is the EFF your 'last hope for service delivery'? We evaluate their manifesto Employment Claim \"More than 8.2 million South Africans do not have a job.\" Verdict mostly-correct When the DA launched their manifesto on 23 April 2016 , the latest available data on unemployment in South Africa was from July to September 2015 . That data showed that 5,418,000 people were unemployed then , according to the narrow definition. These people are unemployed but tried to find a job in the last four weeks. The latest data, from January to March 2016, shows that the number has risen to 5,714,000 . The expanded definition of unemployment includes discouraged job-seekers. These are people who want to work but are not actively trying to find employment. According to the expanded definition, there were 8,304,000 unemployed people in South Africa in July to September 2015. This figure rose to 8,927,000 in the first quarter of 2016. READ: Unemployment statistics in South Africa explained Claim \"Estimates by the City [of Cape Town] found that 161,000 individuals, or 11.3% of the total workforce in Cape Town, were employed by the informal economy in 2015.\" Verdict mostly-correct The estimates of the number of Capetonians working in the informal economy were included in a report on Economic Performance Indicators for Cape Town for the second quarter of 2015, the DA told Africa Check. The informal employment sector, as measured by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), includes people informally employed, as well as people working in the formal sector or private households, but without a written contract or benefits such as medical aid or pension fund contributions. The DA's claim is correct for the second quarter of 2015, Stats SA's quarterly labour force survey shows. 2015 Informal employees in City of Cape Town % of total employment Unemployment rate Jan-Mar 135,000 9.5% 23.5% April-June 161,000 11.3% 22.6% July-Sept 171,000 11.6% 21.9% Oct-Dec 175,000 11.6% 20.5% Source: Stats SA quarterly labour force survey (Jan-March 2016) But the size of Cape Town's informal sector employment as a proportion of total employment is low relative to other metropolitan municipalities in South Africa, professor Dieter von Fintel of the Stellenbosch University's economic department, told Africa Check. Von Fintel said that only Tshwane's proportion was lower than Cape Town's. In turn, South Africa has a comparatively low informal sector share when compared to many developing countries. Claim \"Midvaal [has] the lowest unemployment rate in Gauteng.\" Verdict correct The DA said their claim is based on 2011 census data, which showed that the Midvaal local municipality's unemployment rate was then at 18.8% . Compared to the 3 metropolitan municipalities and 6 other local municipalities in the Gauteng province, Midvaal had the lowest unemployment figures in 2011. Municipality Unemployment rate in 2011 Emfuleni 34.7% Westonaria 29.5% Ekurhuleni 28.8% Merafong City 27.2% Randfontein 27.1% Lesedi 25% City of Johannesburg 25% Mogale City 24.6% City of Tshwane 24.2% Midvaal 18.8% In 2001, the year after the DA first won Midvaal's local government election , census data shows that the unemployment rate was 22.8% . Claim \"Since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed South Africans through [the Expanded Public Works Programme].\" Verdict correct In support of the claim, DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme pointed Africa Check to a City of Cape Town media release from July 2015 . It stated that \"since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed residents through this programme\". This is backed up by the City of Cape Town's annual reports, in which they reported creating 140,324 work opportunities between 2011/12 and 2014/15. ( Note: As Africa Check has previously explained , the number of opportunities does not correspond to the number of people who have benefited from the programme. Someone can be employed on different projects in the programme at different times with each work period counted as a separate job opportunity. ) Financial year Work opportunities reported 2011/12 26,403 2012/13 35,556 2013/14 38,305 2014/15 40,060 Total 140,324 Source: City of Cape Town annual reports Claim The City of Cape Town's \"rate of unemployment\" was 20.5% in 2013/14. This was lower than three other \"major metros\", including the City of Tshwane (23.4%), Nelson Mandela Bay (30.6%) and the City of Johannesburg (27.9%). Verdict incorrect The DA's research unit told Africa Check that \"upon closer inspection we found that the heading for the unemployment figures that appear in the bar graph on page 13 of the manifesto is incorrect\". The unemployment data they cited was actually for October to December in 2015. That year the City of Cape Town's narrow unemployment rate was 20.5% as claimed. However, the metropolitan municipality with the lowest unemployment rate was eThekwini at 15.9% . Municipality Official unemployment rate Expanded unemployment rate City of Cape Town 20.5% 21.8% Buffalo City 23.8% 27.3% Nelson Mandela Bay 30.6% 30.6% Mangaung 22.8% 29.2% eThekwini 15.9% 24.3% City of Joburg 27.9% 29.2% City of Tshwane 23.4% 27.4% Ekurhuleni 30.8% 33% Source: Quarterly Labour Force Survey Quarter 4: 2015 Comparable unemployment data at metropolitan municipality level has only been released in Quarterly Labour Force Surveys since the beginning 2015. Prior to that, it was only available every ten years in the census.The DA referred to the incorrect information as a \"formatting error\" and said it was \"deeply regretted\". The latest data, from January to March of 2016 , shows that the City of Cape Town's unemployment rate had increased to 21.1%. The metropolitan municipality with the lowest unemployment rate was again eThekwini at 18.8%. Pro-poor spending Data provided by the City of Cape Town shows that the figure of 67% refers to what they call the \"service delivery budget\" Claim \"In the 2014/15 financial year, the City of Cape Town spent 67% of its budget in poor communities.\" Verdict incorrect The \"service delivery budget\" includes the line departments City Health, Human Settlements, Safety and Security and Social and Early Childhood Development. It also includes parts of the budgets of other departments, such as Community Services, Transport and Utility Services. A number of departments are not included in the city's calculations. These include Compliance and Auxiliary Services, Corporate Services, Energy, Environment and Spatial Planning, Finance, Rates and Other and Tourism Events and Economic Development. If the city's figure of investment in poor areas and informal settlements (R17,504,774,569) is calculated as a percentage of the total latest publicly available 2014/15 budget (R35,458,835,000), the portion the city says it invested drops to 49.4%. Read our report for a detailed explanation. Governance Claim \"DA-run governments are recognised as among the best in South Africa by national government and a variety of other agencies.\" Verdict correct The DA told Africa Check that they base this claim on three different evaluations: the auditor-general's reports from 2008/9 to 2013/4, as evaluated by the Dullah Omar Institute , a community law centre based at the University of Western Cape, with a research focus on multi-level government among others. the Government Performance Index , a metric compiled by the research and advocacy organisation Good Governance Africa , the Municipal Financial Stability Index (MFSI), compiled by the Ratings Afrika agency. Auditor-general's reports The Dullah Omar Institute publishes an annual Municipal Audit Consistency Barometer in which they categorise a municipality according to the audit outcome it most often achieved over the past 5 years, in this case over the period 2008/9 to 2013/4. There are five possible audit outcomes, listed here from best to worst: Unqualified with no findings (clean), Unqualified with findings, Qualified with findings, Adverse with findings, and Disclaimer with findings. According to the DA, it governs in 26 municipalities across four provinces: Gauteng and the Northern, Eastern and Western Cape. The Dullah Omar Institute's report shows the DA mostly scored clean (unqualified with no findings) and unqualified opinions with findings between 2008/9 and 2013/4: Clean: 6 municipalities (City of Cape Town, George, Langeberg, Mossel Bay, Swartland and West Coast district) Unqualified with findings: 16 municipalities (Bergrivier, Bitou, Breede Valley, Cape Winelands district, Drakenstein, Eden district, Hessequa, Knysna, Laingsburg, Midvaal, Overberg district, Overstrand, Saldanha Bay, Stellenbosch, Theewaterskloof and Witzenberg) Qualified with findings: 1 municipality (Hantam) Disclaimer: 1 municipality (Baviaans) Not submitted: 2 municipalities (Swellendam and Karoo Hoogland). The auditor-general's report for 2014/15 on the outcome of municipal audits , released yesterday, showed that 21 DA-run municipalities achieved a clean audit, 3 an unqualified with findings opinion and 2 a qualified with findings opinion. But the auditor-general's reports speak to financial governance and not necessarily all aspects of service delivery, Karen Heese, an economist at research organisation Municipal IQ told Africa Check. Independent consultant to national and local governments Dr Andrew Siddle explained to Africa Check that the auditor-general's reports show \"three things only: the soundness of financial reporting, [a municipality's] legislative compliance, and the soundness of its reporting on performance management\". When a municipality gets a \"clean\" report, it means that it has passed the test for all three of these elements - \"nothing more, nothing less\". Nonetheless, \"if a municipality passes the 'clean' test, then it may logically claim to be doing some things right, and that can be justifiably be interpreted as a reflection on its approach to governance\", Siddle added. As such, auditor-general reports \"should be and are taken seriously\". Government Performance Index As for the Government Performance Index , the DA told Africa Check that it shows that \"12 out of the 20 best run municipalities in the country are governed by the DA, with 9 of them in the top 10. Good Governance Africa ranked the country's 234 local and metropolitan municipalities according to 15 different criteria across three spheres of performance: administration, economic development and service delivery.\" Africa Check verified the DA's standing in the index. However, Heese cautioned against relying too much on the Government Performance Index as its measure of a municipality's performance is based on limited information. Ratings Africa Africa Check was unable to verify the DA's claims about the Municipal Financial Stability Index produced by Ratings Afrika . Analyst Charl Kocks said the data broken down by municipality was \"proprietary\" and we need to buy the report at a cost of R100,000 to access that. However, Kocks did confirm that the average score for the Western Cape was 60 out of 100 and that it was the highest scoring province in the country, as the DA claimed. However, he could not tell us how many of the 22 DA-run municipalities in the Western Cape were included in the index. Kocks explained that their ratings were based on municipalities complying with their requests for various categories of information. Whether or not all of the 30 municipalities in the Western Cape complied is unknown. Claim \"The City of Cape Town has repealed over 300 [apartheid-era policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures].\" Verdict correct The DA manifesto promises that the party will create \"a regulatory business environment that promotes growth and innovation\". One of the ways it says it will do so is by repealing \"apartheid-era policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures which contradict our commitment to freedom and fairness and which pose barriers to economic development and job-creating growth\". In the City of Cape Town, the DA claimed it had already repealed \"over 300 such policies\". The first document the DA sent us contained only 261 such policies. The list included policies from post-1994 - such as the \"Goodwood Policy on the erection of Wendy houses\" (1997) and \"Fencing guidelines for N1 City, Goodwood\" (2001). In response, the DA said: \"We do not believe the text suggests that the structure plans, bylaws and other procedures are all apartheid-era; indeed, a cursory look at the list should show that the policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures from the democratic era have also been repealed.\" The party then forwarded us a document listing an additional 75 policies, structure plans and frameworks as proof. Health Claim \"The City of Cape Town runs six facilities dedicated to providing treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.\" Verdict correct The DA claims in its manifesto that the City of Cape Town runs treatment centres \"in accordance with the Matrix Model of treatment\" in Delft South, Khayelitsha, Manenberg, Milnerton, Parkwood and Tafelsig. A leaflet provided to Africa Check explains that the Matrix Model is an intensive outpatient treatment programme developed in the US. Africa Check called the centres on the list and confirmed that they offer Matrix Model treatment. However, the international Matrix Institute on Addictions lists only two of the centres as officially accredited on its website . Housing Claim \"The DA is making great strides compared to other metros in the country - as of February 2015, Nelson Mandela Bay had 50,000 outstanding title deeds\" Verdict correct The DA pointed us to a February 2015 parliamentary reply by the ministry of human settlements as proof. It showed that the Nelson Mandela Bay metro had by far the most title deeds yet to issue, followed by the City of Cape Town. Metro Outstanding title deeds on 20 February 2015 Buffalo City 5,835 Nelson Mandela Bay 50,934 Mangaung 5,190 Ekurhuleni Did not submit information City of Johannesburg None outstanding City of Tshwane 8,237 eThekwini 3,628 City of Cape Town 11,059 The figure has since changed. Nelson Mandela Bay's municipal manager, Mthubanzi Mniki told Africa Check only 15,339 title deeds were outstanding as of 30 April 2016. Of these, 1,473 were for pre-1994 housing stock and 13,866 for post-1994 stock. The information is not yet publicly available, though. Water loss Claim \"...the Drakenstein municipality managed to reduce annual water losses from 34.8% to 12.1% in little over a decade. The campaign also showcases how DA local governments can reverse the decline of a municipality by identifying problems and taking proactive steps to address them.\" Verdict incorrect The Drakenstein municipality is located in the Western Cape and comprises the towns of Paarl and Wellington. Van Damme told Africa Check that the figures cited were supplied by the municipality. She provided a booklet which stated that \"water losses in the Drakenstein municipality were an unacceptable 34% in 1999... Through a coordinated programme of action, the municipality reduced the water losses to 12.1% by 2013.\" The municipality was however only formed in December 2000 when the Paarl and Wellington municipalities were amalgamated. Drakenstein municipality spokesman, Mart-Mari\u00e9 Haasbroek, told Africa Check that the figures shared by the DA were from the town of Paarl, located in the Drakenstein municipality. They could not be attributed to the municipality as a whole. \"Before 2012, the statistics for the other towns in Drakenstein were estimated and are therefore less reliable and reflects more erratically. Data for Paarl has always been accurately measured,\" said Haasbroek. Help us fact check! Claim: \"The DA-run City of Cape Town has rolled out more than 200 public Wi-Fi zones, used by tens of thousands of residents on a weekly basis.\" DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme told Africa Check: \"The City of Cape Town currently has 201 public Wi-Fi access points at 78 sites.\" She sent us a spreadsheet of the locations. We have uploaded a number of the locations to this Google map. You can help us fact-check this claim by connecting to the Wi-Fi network to see if it works.

        "doc": "In June the South African government approved a new National Youth Policy that will be implemented until 2020. The policy (with the tag line \"We don't want a hand-out, we want a hand up!\") outlines the problems facing South African youth and suggests policy interventions. Africa Check investigated some of the key claims made in the policy document about youth unemployment and education in South Africa. Unemployment Claim \"According to the South African June 2014 labour force survey, 36.1% of young people between the ages of 15 and 35 are unemployed\" Verdict correct The quarterly labour force survey is carried out four times a year in South Africa. Researchers visit 30,000 households in all areas of the country to ensure that their findings are representative of South Africa as a whole. For the quarter of April to June 2014 , the survey reported 9.4 million people in the age group 15 to 34. Of those people, 3.4 million were unemployed according to the so-called \"narrow definition\"; in other words they didn't have a job but were actively looking for one. This represents 36.1% of the labour force in this age group. The labour force survey for January to March 2015 reported a fraction more people aged 15 to 34 (36.9%) were unemployed. Claim \"The labour absorption rate for young people [is] 30.8%.\" Verdict correct The \"labour absorption rate\" refers to the percentage of people in a certain group who are employed. The labour force survey for the second quarter of 2014 found that 30.8% of people aged 15 to 34 were employed; others were unemployed, in education or training, or not seeking employment for other reasons. For comparison, 62.8% of people aged 35 to 44 were found to be employed. The rate increased to 31.7% in the first quarter of this year . Claim \"Young women face even higher levels of unemployment \u2013 34.5% of young women are neither employed nor at school, including further and higher education, compared to 29.9% of young men.\" Verdict incorrect The labour market dynamics survey measures changes and trends in the labour market. We couldn't find a reference to the figure of  34.5% in the latest version - dating back to 2013. Instead, it showed an even higher share: 41% of women between the ages of 14 to 35 were neither employed nor attending schools, universities or colleges, compared to 31.6% of men. Claim \"About 60% of unemployed youth aged below 35 years have never worked.\" Verdict incorrect The quarterly labour force survey for the first three months of this year estimated that there were 3.7 million unemployed young people between the ages of 15 and 34. Stats SA figures show that 50.6% of unemployed people aged 15 to 34 in this time period had never worked. The highest it has been in recent years was 57.3% in April to June of 2011. A Stats SA report on long-term unemployment estimated that in 2014 two-thirds of young people (65.8%) had been \"unemployed, available for work, and looking for a job for one year or longer\". Claim The employment tax incentive \"had supported the creation of 216,000 young workers in December 2014.\" Verdict incorrect In this year's State of the Nation address, President Jacob Zuma said that the employment tax incentive had been claimed for 270,000 young people . But whether \"young workers\" (be it 216,000 or 270,000) have been \"created\"  has been questioned by researchers. This employment tax incentive came into effect at the start of 2014 and is scheduled to end on 31 December 2016. It is meant to encourage employers to hire new, young or less experienced people between the ages of 18 and 29 by giving companies a tax break when they do. The Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit at the University of Cape Town studied the effect of the incentive in the first six months of 2014. They found that it \"did not have any statistically significant and positive effects on youth employment probabilities\" during this time. Discussing the findings, co-author of the study and associate professor Vimal Ranchhod pointed out that although employers may be claiming tax relief for employees this did not necessarily mean new jobs or workers were created between January and June 2014. Ranchhod said that a portion of those young people would have been employed without the introduction of the incentive. In those cases, employers would receive tax relief for people that they would have employed normally. Education Claim \"Literacy and numeracy skills at primary school level are well below the international average.\" Verdict mostly-correct As Africa Check has said before, making international comparisons of educational outcomes is complex. Comparisons can only be drawn if representative groups of pupils in different countries take part in standardised testing. The Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) is an international non-profit organisation which undertakes education policy research. It is made up of 15 education ministries from South Africa and its neighbours Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, the East African states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, plus Malawi and the islands of Mauritius, Seychelles and Zanzibar (although part of Tanzania, their education ministry functions separately). The average scores for reading and mathematics are 500 points. South Africa's student reading score of 494.9 was below average. It was placed tenth out of the fifteen countries scored. Uganda, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi performed worse than South Africa. Tanzania was the best-performing country. South Africa's mathematics score was also below average at 494.8 points . It was placed eighth out of the fifteen countries. Mozambique, Uganda, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi and Zambia achieved lower rankings. Claim \"Only 31% of young people completed their matric (Grade 12) education.\" Verdict mostly-correct The 2013 general household survey showed that South Africa had nearly 17 million people aged 18 to 35 in that year. Of these people, a third (33.6%) had achieved a matric certificate. Claim \"The percentage of individuals aged 20 years and older who have attained Grade 12 has been growing since 2002, increasing from 21.9% in 2002 to 27.7% in 2013.\" Verdict correct The 2013 General Household Survey revealed that 27.7% of people aged 20 years and older had achieved Grade 12, compared to 21.9% in 2002. Claim \"About 4.3% of 18 to 29-year-olds were enrolled at a higher education institution in the country in 2013 \u2013 up from 4% in 2002.\" Verdict correct The 2013 General Household Survey estimated that less than 4.3% of people aged 18 to 29 were enrolled at higher education institutions, compared to 4% a decade earlier. There were 740, 893 students enrolled at higher education institutions that year. Of these students, 66.4% were black African, 22.3% were white, 6.7% were coloured and 4.7% were Indian/Asian. Enrollment differed according to race. White people aged 18 to 29 are more likely to be studying at a higher education institution than any other race: Race 2002 2013 Black/African 2.8% 3.2% White 15.6% 18.7% Coloured 3.4% 3.1% Indian/Asian 12.7% 9.2% Total 4.0% 4.3% Source: 2013 General Household Survey Edited by Anim van Wyk and Peter Cunliffe-Jones The pictures in this report were taken by young photographers in the Livity Africa media training programme.

        "doc": "Following a drawn-out re-election in 2017 Uhuru Kenyatta is keen on refocusing the national agenda on development. His national address looked forward to securing his legacy as he serves out his final term. But do the claims about what his administration achieved in its first term hold up to close scrutiny? Here's what we found. Devolution Claim \"From an allocation of KSh210 billion in the FY 2013/2014, we now stand at KSh327 billion for the FY 2017/2018, an increase of 56% in five years.\" Verdict downplayed In 2010, a new constitution provided for the creation of 47 county governments. The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. This amount is calculated using \"the most recent audited accounts of revenue received, as approved by the National Assembly\". Kenyatta said his government was \"today far above\" the constitutional threshold, adding that the allocations had in the five years since 2013, when the counties started operations, grown by 56%. In the 2013/2014 financial year, the government allocated KSh210 billion to the counties in total according to the 2013 Division of Revenue Act . That was the total allocation including the equitable share, which was KSh190 billion and 28% of the 2011/2012 revenues, which had been audited by parliament but not yet approved by the time the law was passed. For the financial year 2017/2018, the 2017 Division of Revenue Act shows the national government allocated KSh302 billion in equitable share and KSh345.68 billion in total to the counties, not KSh327 billion as stated by the president. The figure was thus understated by KSh18.69 billion and is actually a 65% rise in the five years. - Vincent Ng'ethe Economy Claim \"Our real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.9 percent in 2017.\" Verdict correct Kenyatta said that despite the challenges posed by a prolonged 2017 election and drought, the Kenyan economy \"remained resilient\". According to the 2018 Economic Survey recently released by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , Kenya's gross domestic product at market prices is estimated to have grown 4.9% in 2017. Kenya's GDP growth under President Kenyatta Year GDP growth 2013 5.7% 2014 5.3% 2015 5.6% 2016 5.9% 2017 4.9% Source: Various surveys by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics While it is the first time economic growth has fallen below 5% under Kenyatta, the 2017 slowdown is actually a good news story \"given the disruptions we have had\", development economist Anzetse Were told Africa Check. In an earlier review of this figure, Were said that \"previous analysis indicates that the economy tends to slow down in an election year by about 1.2%-1.4%\". The use of \"real GDP\" as opposed to market price GDP does not change the figures as inflation is usually considered when calculating economic growth from year to year. This Kwame Owino, the chief executive officer of Nairobi-based economic think-tank Institute of Economic Affairs , told Africa Check. - Vincent Ng'ethe Health Claim \"Maternal mortality fell from 488 deaths per 100,000 lives to 362 deaths per 100,000.\" Verdict correct A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth or within 6 weeks after birth, but not from accidental or incidental (such as self-harm) causes. When given as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in a specified period it is referred to as a maternal mortality ratio. The United Nations views a ratio of fewer than 100 deaths per 100,000 live births as low. Once the ratio crosses the 300 barrier, it is considered high and above 500 very high. The president's figure of 488 deaths per 100,000 births was from the 2008-09 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Dr Elizabeth Kimani-Murage, the head of the maternal and child wellbeing unit at the African Population and Health Research Center , told Africa Check. This survey covered the 10 years before and is what would have been available to Kenyatta's government when it took office in 2013. In November 2015, the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey was published and remains the most recent. This survey estimated that Kenya's maternal mortality ratio was 362 deaths per 100,000 live births. Survey data was not available to the UN But the UN estimated this figure at 510 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015. This is because data from the DHS 2014 had not been available to the UN when it published its modelled estimates, Dr Doris Chou, a medical officer at the World Health Organisation's department of reproductive health and research, told Africa Check. The \"confidence intervals\" of the two estimates - the UN and the DHS - overlap meaning it was highly likely that there was no statistical difference between them. \"When we update our estimates, the 2014 DHS information will be included, and its inclusion will likely make the differences observed between the internationally comparable UN estimates and the DHS smaller; because more country-specific data is being used to help shape the estimates,\" Chou said. - Lee Mwiti Claim \"The NHIF coverage widened from a membership of 3.8 million in 2013 to 7.2 million currently.\" Verdict mostly-correct This claim is one of the president's \"Big Four\" agenda for the next five years. Its aim is to have every Kenyan covered by medical insurance by the end of his current and final term. The national statistics office in 2013/14 put the membership of the National Health Insurance Fund at 3.8 million . During his inauguration in November 2017, Kenyatta put the number of Kenyans covered by the National Health Insurance Fund as 6.8 million \"beneficiaries\". The Economic Survey 2018 released by the national statistics office also has the same number for 2016/7. Kenyatta said his administration intended to raise the number of beneficiaries to 13 million \"Kenyans and their dependents\" within five years. Kenyatta was referring to principal members when he talked of \"beneficiaries\", the public insurer told Africa Check in January 2018. It further provided information showing it had 7,058,603 contributing members at the end of December 2017. (Note: However, only half of this number - or 3,500,478 - were active members, meaning that only they and their dependents could be treated at approved hospitals immediately. Members in arrears must first update their account if they are to be treated, and this can take up to 30 days, meaning the president's claim needs more context.) - Lee Mwiti Claim \"We have increased health facilities from 9,000 in 2013 to 11,000 in 2017.\" Verdict incorrect According to the health ministry's national staffing plan for 2014-2018 , there were 7,795 health facilities in 2013 . These ranged from dispensaries to national hospitals. Of these, 3,956 were government-owned, 881 faith-based, 306 run by not-for-profits and 2,652 were privately owned. According to the ministry's Kenya Master Health Facility List , as at 3 May 2018, there were 10,111 health facilities in Kenya, all of which are operational . A January 2018 national treasury report notes an increase in the number of health facilities \"from just about 9,000 before devolution to 10,000\". - Vincent Ng'ethe Tourism Claim \"Tourism earnings grew 20% in 2017.\" Verdict correct Kenyatta said that despite what had been a protracted election year, receipts from tourism had actually grown. In 2017, Kenya earned KSh119.9 billion from tourism according to the 2018 Economic Survey. This, the national statistics office said, was a 20.3% increase from 2016, when earnings were KSh99.7 billion. The data agency attributed this to an 8% rise in the number of international visitors from 1.34 million in 2016 to 1.45 million in 2017. - Vincent Ng'ethe Roads Claim \"When I assumed office as President, we promised to tarmac 10,000 kms roads across the country; we are on target having completed 3,000 kms to-date and with a further 5,000 kms under construction.\" Verdict unproven Kenya has a total road network of 161,451 km, according to the 2017/2018 annual public roads programm e published by the Kenya Roads Board . It does not, however, break this down by type. The country had 11,200 km of bitumen road in 2013 when Kenyatta took office. This is according to the Economic Survey 2018. The new administration pledged to increase this to 24,000 km of paved road in the next five years, or by 12,800 km. Evaluating this claim is further compounded by the variation in official data. In 2017, the national statistics office said that bitumen roads had increased to 20,600 km, or by 9,400 km. In 2016, the agency had the tarmac road network at 14,500 km, meaning 6,100 km of road was added in just one year. (Note: In the same year the statistics office also has a figure of 11,796 km of tarmac road.) But a January 2018 report by the national treasury showed that between the financial years of 2013/2014 and 2016/2017, some 1,919 km of bitumen road were built. Our year-long efforts to get data from the government on the status of the road network have so far turned up empty. We will keep trying, however. Electricity Claim \"You might also recall the expansion of Last-Mile Connectivity, which has brought electricity to 71% of households, up from 27% in 2013.\" Verdict incorrect According to Kenya Power, the country's electricity utility, \"last mile\" refers to the last link to the consumers' premise or home. The Last-Mile Connectivity project was rolled out in 2015 and seeks to increase electricity access, especially in rural and peri-urban areas, by subsidising connection costs. It is funded by government and a clutch of donors. As at June 2017, some 49,813 new customers had been connected under it. According to Kenya Power, there were 1.69 million domestic customers at the end of its 2012/2013 financial year. (Note: A breakdown of how electricity consumers are categorised can be found here .) The 2012 /2013 Kenya National Housing Survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics estimated that Kenya had 9.2 million households in 2013, meaning 18.4% - not 27% - were connected. As at May 2018, Kenya Power had 6.67 million domestic consumers, 2.4 million of who were postpaid and 4.3 million prepaid, according to company spokesman Johnstone Ole Turana. Each household should have its own meter, he added, and in an apartment, each house also has its meter. Kenya had 11.4 million households in 2016, according to the Basic Report on Well-being in Kenya released in March 2018 by the national statistics office. Using this data, the number of connected households works out to 58.4% and not 71%. The country's next census is set for 2019. - Lee Mwiti & Vincent Ng'ethe Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/fact-checked-kenyattas-2017-state-nation-address/",

It was also the fifth - and final - Sona address of the current administration before this year's national elections in May. But did the president get his facts right as he listed the government's achievements? Africa Check partnered with 24-hour news channel eNCA to fact-check his claims on the night. The economy Claim \"In 2017, we recorded an inflow of foreign direct investment amounting to R17 billion.\" Verdict correct Foreign direct investments are made by companies or individuals from one country into businesses in another country. Data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development shows that US$1.325 billion of foreign money was invested in South Africa in 2017. This is about R17.3 billion at the 30 June 2017 exchange rate. It's a however a decrease from US$2.235 billion - or R29.2 billion - in 2016. The figures sounded \"about right\", said Prof Jannie Rossouw, head of the school of economic and business sciences at Wits University . But \"it's nothing in the bigger scheme of things... it's less than a percentage [point] of our economy\". -Cayley Clifford READ: Misleading to say South Africa's GDP has grown 'three fold' since 1994 Claim \"The World Bank's annual Doing Business Report currently puts South Africa number 82 out of 190 countries that they have tracked with regard to being able to do business in an efficient way.\" Verdict correct The World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" index rates countries on a scale of 0 (absolute poor ease of doing business) to 100 (absolute better ease of doing business). The score is calculated from indicators such as how long it takes to open a business or transfer a property and how easy it is to access credit. South Africa was ranked 82nd with a score of 66.03 in 2018. New Zealand was ranked first, with a score of 86.59. The report says high-ranking countries \"are those that have consistently well designed business regulation or whose regulatory environments have thrived thanks to comprehensive reform over the years\". Somalia placed last at 190th, with a score of 20.04. - Lloyd Hazvineyi Infrastructure Claim \"Over the past five years, we've made significant progress with the provision of infrastructure. More than R1.3 trillion has been invested.\" Verdict mostly-correct Some R1.26 trillion was spent on infrastructure in the last five financial years, according to numbers from the national treasury. Spending on public infrastructure in South Africa from 2013/14 to 2017/18 Financial year Spend (R billion) 2013/14 244.8 2014/15 262.2 2015/16 261.2 2016/17 249.8 2017/18 241.8 Total 1,259.8 SOURCE: NATIONAL TREASURY These amounts include infrastructure spending at all levels of government, by state-owned companies and other public entities (such as  the Property Management Trading Entity in the department of public works) as well as public funds spent in public-private partnerships. The treasury says capital items such as equipment, machinery and vehicles are excluded. But public housing, maintenance and repairs are part of the definition of infrastructure spending applied here. - Liesl Pretorius Claim \" Over the past five years..more than R1.3 trillion has been invested to build [infrastructure including] hundreds of thousands of new homes...\" Verdict correct Public housing is included in the national treasury's definition of public-sector infrastructure spending . According to the department of human settlements, close to 500,000 homes, or \"housing units\", were delivered in the past five financial years. Government-funded houses built (2013/14 to 2017/18) Financial year Houses/units 2013/14 105,936 2014/15 94,566 2015/16 99,904 2016/17 89,186 2017/18 86,006 Total 475,598 SOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SETTLEMENTS Subsidised houses, rental accommodation, hostel upgrades and council houses where ownership was granted were counted as units built, departmental spokesperson Xolani Xundu confirmed. - Liesl Pretorius Claim \"Over the past five years... more than R1.3 trillion has been invested to build [infrastructure including electrifying] more than a million homes.\" Verdict correct Close to 1.2 million homes were connected to the electricity grid from April 2014 to October 2018, according to the department of energy . The April 2018 to October 2018 figures are provisional, as they haven't been audited yet. Electricity grid connections in South Africa from April 2014 to October 2018 Financial year Connections 2014/15 233,455 2015/16 231,012 2016/17 301,976 2017/18 275,830 April to October 2018 122,485 (provisional) Total 1,164,758 SOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY These numbers exclude electricity supply that isn't connected to the national grid. - Liesl Pretorius Jobs Claim \"We have launched the Youth Employment Service, which is placing unemployed youth in paid internships in companies across the country.\" Verdict correct The Youth Employment Service initiative was launched on 27 March 2018 with the aim of creating a million jobs for young people using \"innovation and technological best practice\". Only 6,939 'work experiences' committed so far The initiative is a partnership between the government, business, labour and civil society. It will provide work experience, job placements (or the option for businesses to \"sponsor\" work placements) and training for people aged 18 to 35. According to its website, 319 companies have registered for the service so far but only 6,939 \"work experiences\" have been confirmed. - Naphtali Khumalo READ: Has SA's President Ramaphosa kept his 2018 State of the Nation promises? Social grants Claim \"Every month 17.5 million social grants are provided to South Africans.\" Verdict correct The South African Social Security Agency administers social grants. Its most recent data on grants is from December 2018, when 17,731,402 social grants were paid. The lowest number of grants delivered in 2018 was 17,396,831 in January. The average for the 2017/18 financial year ending in March 2018 was 17,509,555 grants. The number has however grown steadily - in 2007/08 the average was 12,423,739. Growth in social grants in South Africa from 2013/14 to 2017/18 Financial year Number of grants 2017/18 17,509,995 2016/17 17,200,525 2015/16 16,991,634 2014/13 16,642,643 2013/14 15,932,473 SOURCE: SASSA 2017/18 Annual Report Grants help counteract the effects of poverty in South Africa, Prof Jeremy Seekings , the director of the Centre for Social Science Research at the University of Cape Town , told Africa Check. \" There is abundant evidence that grants improve nutrition \u2013 especially for children \u2013 and health, and provide dignity to otherwise marginalised social and demographic groups,\" Seekings said. - Lee Mwiti FACTSHEET: Social grants in South Africa \u2013 separating myth from reality Education Claim \"Over 700,000 children [accessed] early childhood education in the last financial year...\" Verdict downplayed This isn't the first time Ramaphosa has underestimated the number of children in early childhood development facilities in South Africa. In last year's State of the Nation address, he put the number at \" nearly one million children \". This year, his figure is \"over 700,000\". Both are way below the actual numbers. Martin Gustafsson, an economics researcher at the University of Stellenbosch , says there are \" widespread misperceptions around how many children in South Africa attend some form of ECD institution\". He has researched and written extensively on the economics of education and pre-school participation. 'How seriously South Africa takes education' Using data from Statistics South Africa, Gustafsson estimates that 2,409,953 children were in some kind of pre-school in 2016. ( Note: These were children who were younger than eight at the start of 2016. ) The 2017 general household survey reported that just over 2 million children under the age of four were attending a \"day care centre, cr\u00e8che, early childhood development centre (ECD) playgroup, nursery school or preprimary school\". Knowing how many children are in these facilities is important for the government's policy planning. Gustafsson adds that the existing underestimates may send the wrong signal to international investors about \"how seriously South Africa takes the education of its citizens\". - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"Over the past five years\u2026 [we've built] two new universities.\" Verdict correct In 2014, Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley, Northern Cape, and the University of Mpumalanga in Nelspruit opened their doors to students. According to the public infrastructure update in the 2018 Budget Review, construction at these institutions is ongoing . \" New facilities include lecture rooms, laboratories, sport and recreation amenities and student accommodation.\" - Liesl Pretorius Claim \"We launched the Safe initiative in August last year...\" Verdict correct The Sanitation Appropriate For Education ( Safe) initiative was launched on 14 August 2018. Partners in the project include the department of basic education , National Education Collaboration Trust and Nelson Mandela Foundation . Its main objective is to replace unsafe school toilet facilities - like pit latrines - with safe ones. A national government audit of schools in May and June 2018 found that at 3,898 schools the only toilets available were pit latrines. Another 3,040 had \"proper sanitation\", but pit toilets were still on the premises. - Lloyd Hazvineyi READ: Have 'hundreds' of kids drowned in school pit latrines in South Africa? Claim \"... Since we launched the initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects and a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages.\" Verdict unproven The president's figures were from December 2018, the department of basic education told Africa Check. Since then 88 more schools have been completed, bringing the total to 787, spokesperson Troy Martens told Africa Check. Companies that pledged to support the plan have also been meeting their obligations, Martens added. But it was difficult to independently verify the department's numbers, two education-focused civil society organisations told Africa Check. - Lloyd Hazvineyi Tourism Claim \"In the past year we had 10 million tourists who came to our country, which is a huge increase .\" Verdict unproven Statistics South Africa defines a tourist as \"an overnight visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation in the place visited\". In 2017 South Africa had 10,825,197 tourists, according to the agency. It had 10,044,163 tourists in 2016 and 8,903,773 in 2015. Full data for 2018 is not yet available but, from January to November 2018 there were 9,464,950 tourist arrivals, according to Stats SA's tourism and migration report released in January 2019. It seems likely that the figure will increase to 10 million tourists. But in the absence of data for the full year we rate the claim unproven. ( Note: We will update this report when the data is released. ) - Naphtali Khumalo",

The organisation\u2019s communication specialist for youth and population, Eddie Wright, relayed comment from members of their technical division.\u201cOur technical experts wish to stress that most sources of maternal mortality rates have substantial biases or uncertainties, as in general, it is hard to measure,\u201d Wright wrote. \u201cBut [the rate for women] under age 15 is particularly difficult - first because births below 15 are less common and the locations where pregnancies at this age are more likely to occur are also locations where all records of such events are less reliable.\u201dGiven that \u201csound data are hard to secure\u201d the organisation relies on two studies, in particular, Wright added.The first is a study based on data collected in the late 1960s in a rural Bangladesh county, which showed a death rate for mothers aged 10 to 14 that was 4.7 higher than for those aged 20 to 24.The second was a hospital-based study carried out in several Latin American countries between 1985 and 2003. The results indicated a 4 time higher risk for teen mothers younger than 15 compared to those in the 20-24 age group.A University of Southampton lecturer with interests in maternal health in low and middle-income countries, Dr Sarah Neal, co-authored a study in The Lancet reviewing maternal mortality rates in 144 countries.\u201cIt used to be believed that all adolescents were at very increased risk of maternal mortality,\u201d she told Africa Check. However, this study and another she co-authored suggested \u201cthe risks are not as great or universal as previously believed\u201d.Neal is currently systematically reviewing the studies to estimate how the risk differs for younger teenagers. (Note: We will update the report once her findings are released.)\u201cData from large-scale studies in Africa are limited, but I think research certainly consistently suggests the risk for young adolescents are marked higher than for older adolescents or women in their 20s,\u201d she said.\u201cI would be reluctant to put a figure on how much more of a risk it is though based on the data available and the fact it may well vary regionally.We therefore rate this claim unproven until better data are available.",

        "doc": "In February 2014, Africa Check published a column which questioned the sourcing of various pre-election claims being made on Twitter by South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). The DA's then social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the party strives to ensure that any claims its makes are accurate and added that if Africa Check \"finds that any of these statistics are inaccurate, we will gladly rectify them.\" Many of the DA's claims relate to its performance in the Western Cape, the only province in the country that is not held by the governing African National Congress. This report - the first of two on the DA - evaluates a number of key claims made by the party on Twitter using the hashtag #DADelivers. It forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on May 7 2014. Claim \"In the 2nd half of 2012/13, the WC Provincial Govt. created 60,000 work opportunities via the Expanded Public Works Projects. #DAdelivers\" Verdict incorrect The DA's former social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the claim was based on the Expanded Public Works Programme's second quarterly report for 2012/13 .  But according to that report,  68,044 work opportunities were created in the Western Cape in the first half of 2012/13, not the second half as stated in the DA's tweet. If the claim was based on the first half of the year, then it understated performance. The third and fourth quarterly reports - which cover the second half of the year - have yet to be released and it is unclear how many work opportunities were created then. Claim \"@DA_News municipalities have created 31,000 job opportunities in the past year. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven This claim appears to have first been tweeted by Gavin Davis, the DA's communications director, on 1 March 2013 . It was then recycled by the DA which tweeted it on several different dates including 18 September , 2 October , 18 November and 30 December 2013. The claim was also included in the party's 2014 election manifesto , which was launched in February 2014. It is therefore unclear whether the claim refers to a calendar year, a financial year or a specific 12 month period. If it was the latter, then - given the fact that the tweet was used on several different dates - which 12 month period did it refer to? According to the DA, the claim is supported by the Expanded Public Works Programme's second quarterly report for 2012/13 .  But that report states that 18,104 work opportunities were created in Western Cape district and metropolitan municipalities between 1 April 2012 and 30 September 2013. A further 7,491 work opportunities were created during the same period in Western Cape local municipalities. Add them together and you get a total of 25, 595. Claim \"W Cape has best delivery record in SA: 99.1% of households access piped water, 93.4% electricity & 96.9% have toilet facilities. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct According to the DA, the claim is supported by data collected during South Africa's 2011 national census . The census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water. According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng. However, when it came to accessing toilets, the Western Cape slipped from first place. According to the census, 98.9% of Gauteng households had access to a toilet. In the Western Cape 96.9% of households had access to toilets. (An earlier Africa Check report evaluated similar claims about water access made by the national government.) Claim \"The City of Cape Town delivers more to poor residents than any other city in the country. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven The DA says the claim is supported by a 2011 report on household access to basic services which was compiled by the national government's Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs. The report, which in fact used data from 2009, ranked the City of Cape Town first in the country for providing services to households. It stated that 90% of households there had achieved basic service levels and 88% had achieved higher service levels. It's important to note that the report referred to \"the levels of household access to basic service\" throughout the city and did not refer specifically to poor residents. Andre Bothma, the DA's marketing director,  told Africa Check that the claim was also supported by the City of Cape Town's Mid-Year Review (2011-2013) which stated that \"[t]he City of Cape Town has the best record of any metro in the country for providing basic services, and providing financial relief to the poor\". However, the review provided no evidence or data to support the claim and it is unclear how it arrived at its conclusion that the city had the \"best record of any metro in the country\". The 2012 non-financial census of municipalities revealed that the Western Cape has the highest percentage of households in the country receiving free basic water, electricity and sewerage and sanitation. Claim \"The [South African] gap between the 'haves' & the 'havenots' is smallest in City of Cape Town. It has the highest level of equality in SA. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct The DA based the claim on the 2010/2011 State of the World's Cities report produced by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. The report, which used the Gini coefficient to compare inequality between cities, suggested that East London and Johannesburg were some of the most unequal cities in the world. While Cape Town was found to have high levels of inequality by world standards, it was found to be the least unequal of the South African cities examined for the report.  Of the South African cities analysed, Cape Town had the lowest Gini coefficient at 0.67 while East London and Johannesburg had the highest Gini coefficients at 0.75. The 2012/2013 State of the World's Cities report found that Cape Town was a more broadly prosperous city than Johannesburg, the only other South African city examined. Claim \"Of the R18 billion spent on service delivery in the City of Cape Town, R11billion is spent on the poor communities. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven Andre Bothma, the DA's marketing director, said the claim was based on a 2012 City of Cape Town expenditure analysis. He told Africa Check the document is not publicly available. (This contradicts a statement by Molteno, the DA's former social media manager, who told us that the DA keeps a database of \"DA delivery facts, each accompanied by a reference to a source for it that is publicly available \".) Bothma also referred us to a September 2012 speech by Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille in which the claim was made. But De Lille made no reference to the source of the claim. Her spokesman, Solly Malatsi, said the claim was taken from the City of Cape Town's 2012/13 budget using \"data analytics models\". \"Using the basis of service delivery departments as the quantum of focus, we then tabulate expenditure patterns using a ward analysis of geographical income distributions in the City matched against a formula of total spending amounts to arrive at the percentage-based figure,\" he explained. Africa Check has been unable to independently verify the accuracy of claim. Claim \"80% of the R2 billion spent by the Western Cape Government on tenders during 2012/2013 was paid to #BEEbusinesses. #DAdelivers\" Verdict correct The DA says the claim is based on a Western Cape government analysis of expenditure .The analysis states that '[i]n the 2012/13 financial year, the majority of tenders over R100 000 were awarded to BEE firms. In total, bids worth R1.6 billion went to BEE firms\". This amounts to 80% of the total. Claim \"65% of the Western Cape Govt's senior management are previously disadvantaged South Africans. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven The DA claims that the tweet was sourced from the 2013 \"Western Cape Human Resource Database\". Bothma told Africa Check that the database was not publicly accessible. When asked if there were other documents that supported the claim, Bothma directed us to a Times LIVE article and a City Press article in which the Western Cape premier and DA leader, Helen Zille, claimed that \"77 percent of our 50,521 senior employees fell within the designated 'black group'\". No source for that claim was provided. We have been unable to independently verify the accuracy of the claim. Claim \"76% of the Western Cape Government's budget is redistributed to poor communities. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven Bothma referred Africa Check to a presentation compiled by Western Cape Premier Helen Zille's office on provincial ' expenditure on the poor '. However, the source provided does not support the claim. The presentation, delivered by Helen Zille in August 2012, claims that an analysis of a representative sample of departments revealed that 76% of their budgets were redistributed to poor communities. Only the departments of health, education, human settlements, social development and cultural affairs and sport were considered in the analysis. Expenditure in eight other provincial departments was not analysed. Claim \"8 of the top 10 South African municipalities in the Municipal IQ's Productivity Index are governed by @DA_News. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct This claim has been tweeted a number of times since November 2013 and is said to have been taken from Municipal IQ's 2013 Productivity Index. Municipal IQ is an independent data service that monitors and assesses South Africa municipalities. The claim is not strictly correct (though it is close) as the index shows that six of the ten top-performing local municipalities are run by the DA and one is run by a DA-Cope coalition. Claim \"In its first four years in government, the DA-governed City of Cape Town tripled the number of houses delivered per year. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct The DA said that the claim was sourced from the Cape Town Story , a booklet published by the DA in March 2011. It claimed that \"the post-2006 City government has built three times the number of houses its predecessor managed\". Frouwien Bosman, a DA policy researcher, told Africa Check that the claim was based on comparing the average number of houses delivered under the ANC to the number delivered under the DA in 2008/09 and 2009/10. In 2003/04 , 2004/05 and 2005/06 , the last three years the ANC ran the City of Cape Town, an average of 3,287 housing opportunities were provided, according to the city's annual reports. Under the DA , 9,576 housing opportunities were delivered in the city in 2008/09 and 8,950 housing opportunities were delivered in 2009/10. In 2010/11 and 2011/12 , the number of housing opportunities delivered dropped to 7,472 and 7,141 respectively. Claim \"The W Cape Govt spends R33.6mil on its Premier's Advancement of Youth Project & its youth wage subsidy programme every year. #DADelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct Bothma told Africa Check that the \"youth wage subsidy programme\" that the tweet refers to is the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism's \"Work and Skills Programme\". Bronwynne Jooste, a spokesperson for the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, told Africa Check that R10-million was spent each year on the programme in 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. Expenditure decreased to R8.9-million in 2012/13 and R13.4-million was spent on the programme in 2013/14. Jooste couldn't provide a document or an audit to support the figures. She said that the Work and Skills Programme's expenditure was not accounted for separately in the department's financial statements and was included under the broader category of \"workforce development\". The Premier's Advancement of Youth Project started in 2012/13. Zak Mbhele, Zille's spokesman in her capacity as Premier,  told Africa Check that R23,1-million is spent every year on the Premier's Advancement of Youth Project. This, he said, was based on paying 750 interns R2,400 per month for 12 months. An annual amount of R1,5-million is also allocated for administrative costs. But Mbhele was unable to provide documentation to support the figure.  \"\u2026[T]he remuneration expenditure on the [Premier's Advancement of Youth Project] is part and parcel of personnel costs across all departments and is not reflected in a separate, collated document,\" he explained via email. If the figures provided by Jooste and Mbhele are correct, it would appear that a combined total of R32-million was spent in 2012/13 financial year and  a further R36.5 million in 2013/14. These figures are close to, but not in line with, the R33.6-million per year that the DA's claim refers to. It is unclear how the DA calculated that figure.

Steer clear of them as they are on a scamming spree. Three Facebook accounts Lulu Hassan Gifts , Lulu Hassan Citizentvgift and Lulu Hassan Gifts are promising Facebook users thousands of Kenyan shillings to take part in what they call \"promotions\". The accounts use photos of Lulu Hassan, a prominent news anchor on Kenya's Citizen TV , as their profile pictures. They have posted multiple times to Facebook groups with thousands of members. They post simple queries and ask users to respond for a chance to win thousands of Kenyan shillings. The questions are wide-ranging but simple, for example asking users for names starting or ending with certain letters of the alphabet. The accounts have posted on different dates here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are these Facebook accounts and their offers legit? We checked. Signs of fake Facebook accounts Each of the Facebook accounts in question are relatively new and have little activity on their timelines. But, suspiciously, they have posted promotions on multiple Facebook groups. This is usually a sign of a scam, since it indicates that these accounts are created for the sole purpose of running bogus promotions across Facebook groups. The promotions on the suspicious accounts do not appear on Hassan's official Facebook page , which has over 1.4 million followers. We also checked her verified Instagram account , which has over 1.5 million followers, and could not find the promotions. We noted that each of the accounts invite users to engage privately on WhatsApp. This is another common trick used by scammers in Kenya. Once users reach out hoping to be awarded, they are asked to pay an \"unlocking\" or \"registration\" fee. Ultimately, there is no reward and scammers get away with the user's money. We have debunked similar scams here , here , here and here . To help protect yourself against online fraudsters, read our guide to Facebook scams and how to spot them.",

But Nigerians are being urged to be cautious as the platform may be out to scam them. A Facebook user is calling on Nigerians who want to grow their money to join a new platform called 777. \"About us - 777 PLATFORM is a Big Investment platform where anyone can come and get profit easily. It's a brand new trading site that helps you to trade your money and get your money doubled within 3 minutes. Suppose trading 5 USD and getting 10 USD in return within 3 minutes isn't that amazing?\" says the user in a 3 September 2023 post . The post features two links: one for registration and another to join the platform's \"official group \" on instant messaging app Telegram. We found similar posts here , here , here , and here . But is this investment platform legit? We checked. What did we find? Africa Check questioned the legitimacy of the platform and its website link as provided on the post , and found a number of red flags. The suspicious post claims that \" 777 \" is a newly launched platform. But according to WhoIs , a site that stores historical data about other websites, the platform's website was created in February 2005. The details of the person who registered the platform's website are \"REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\". This is a red flag, as a trustworthy and legitimate business would be expected to be transparent about its operations and ownership. Website verification tool, ScamAdviser , says the platform's website could possibly be a scam and gives it \" a low trust score\" . Furthermore, Africa Check found \"poor\" online reviews of the \"777 Platform\". Most people on Trustpilot , a website that hosts reviews in order to build trust between consumers and businesses, said the platform was a scam and detailed how they lost their money on it. Platforms that offer to double your money in a short period of time should always raise suspicion as they are unsustainable. All signs point to \"777 Platform\" being a scam. Warning to the public Facebook users are often urged not to put their trust and money into platforms that promise large returns in a short period of time. In August 2022, the Cable , a media company based in Nigeria, reported that the country's Security and Exchange Commission warned of unlicensed operations such as Ponzi schemes, money doubling schemes and other investment platforms. Similarly, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Commission , a federal government agency that supervises banks, warned against fraudulent financial institutions and urged Nigerians not to fall victim to such scams.

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Citizen TV's Rashid Abdalla is one of the most popular news anchors in Kenya. But he's also popular with fraudsters, who use his name and photos on Facebook to scam people. Three Kenyan-based Facebook accounts \u2013 Rashidd Abdala , Rashid Abdala and Rashid Citizen \u2013 have been posting promotions on different Facebook groups in Kenya with thousands of members. The accounts use photos of Kenyan news anchors and married couple Rashid Abdalla and Lulu Hassan . The two are journalists at Kenya's Citizen TV, a privately owned station with a wide reach. The accounts ask users to answer simple questions to stand a chance of winning thousands of Kenyan shillings. A typical post reads : \"Mama John ako na watoto tano ,, Tata,Tete,Titi,Toto. mtoto wa tano ni nani Jibu ujishindie 35,000 Sasa hivi.\" This mix of English and Kiswahili translates to: \"John's mother has five children: Tata, Tete, Titi, Toto. Who is the fifth child? Answer and win yourself KSh35,000 now.\" The accounts have posted on different Facebook groups here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the Facebook accounts and their offers to be trusted? We checked. Fake Facebook accounts The first sign the accounts are imposters are the misspelt names of the journalist on two of them and a missing second name, Abdalla, on the third. The correct spelling of his name is Rashid Abdalla. We checked Abdalla's verified Instagram account , where he has 718,000 followers, and found no mention of such promotions. Similarly, no such posts appear on Hassan's verified Instagram account , which has over 1.5 million followers. It's unlikely that either journalists would operate these Facebook accounts but not feature the promotions on their Instagram accounts, which have much larger followings. The goal of posts like these is often to get users to engage with them by liking, commenting or sharing. This is a tactic known as engagement bait and is used to increase the reach of the posts. Usually, users are eventually asked to send money as an \"unlocking\" or \"registration\" fee before they can receive their winnings. But they won't be rewarded and will have lost their money. This is a common trick used by scammers in Kenya. The accounts in Abdalla's name and their promotions are fake. Africa Check has previously debunked such accounts here , here and here .

We expose three Facebook pages using the name to steal from unsuspecting users. Three Facebook pages Maria Yasmin , Maria Wa Kitaa Cctv and Mariah Yasmin frequently post promotions and promise users quick cash prizes. The pages appear to ride on the popularity of Yasmeen Saiedi, an actor who played the main character on the Kenyan TV show Maria on Citizen TV . They use her photos and stage name. Each of the pages target public Facebook groups with thousands of members and try to convince them to initiate a private conversation to claim their \"gifts\". In the promotions, users are asked simple questions, such as identifying missing numbers from a list, mentioning names that start with certain letters of the alphabet, or wishing local celebrities a happy birthday. Some of the posts can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Together they've received hundreds of comments. But are the Facebook pages and the offers legit? We checked. Fake Facebook pages We checked Saiedi's verified Instagram account , which has over 781,000 followers, and found no offers like the ones on Facebook. It's unlikely that the actor would run the promotions on less popular Facebook pages and not on her Instagram account, where she has a large following. We also noted that each of the Facebook pages had very little activity on their timelines. This suggests they were created for running the promotions on Facebook groups. Most celebrities in Kenya use their pages to interact with fans, post photos and promote products. The Facebook pages ask those who comment to reach out privately to claim their rewards. Africa Check has interacted with such posts before and we were told to pay an \"unlocking\" or \"registration\" fee for us to be awarded. This is usually an attempt to scam the public. The pages and their offers are fraudulent. Africa Check has debunked similar Facebook pages here and here .",

The account uses the name and logo of MSport , a well-known betting site in Nigeria. On the legitimate site users can fund their accounts, make predictions about upcoming matches and place bets.

The post has attracted over 100 comments. Similar posts can be found here , here , here , here and here . Signs of a scam The official Facebook page of the company is MSport , quite different from \" Msport active bonus \". The company does not appear to have a separate Facebook account for bonuses or giveaways. The official account has over 100,000 followers, while the suspicious page only has nine. MSport's Facebook page links to its website , which in turn directs users to all its social media accounts. The suspicious page has no website link and its \"page transparency\" section shows that it was created on 8 July 2023. The official page was created in September 2019. MSport Nigeria is also licensed by the National Lottery Regulatory Commission to operate as a gambling platform in the country. The suspicious page asks users to send a private message to claim their bonuses. This is a technique frequently used by con artists to steal people's money or personal information. MSport gifts and bonuses MSport has called users' attention to a similar claim of a N40,000 bonus offer. \"Please note that this is a fraudulent message broadcasted by some fraudsters in your region,\" reads a post on MSport's X page.

He was also correct that nearly a billion people don't have clean cooking energy, and that African countries pay at least five times the interest rates of other countries when they borrow internationally. But we found no evidence of his claim that 93% of Kenya's national grid is powered by renewable energy, or about the number of new jobs Africa needs to create every year. Kenyan president William Ruto hosted the Africa Climate Summit in the capital Nairobi in September, the first of its kind in the region. Despite the conspicuous absence of major economies such as Nigeria and South Africa, and protests outside the venue, the historic talks resulted in a regional declaration on climate change that pressed for better funding from wealthier nations. Ruto called for urgent action , including to address food insecurity, create jobs and reduce borrowing costs. In his opening remarks, he made a number of claims to highlight the scale of the problem. We scrutinised seven for accuracy. The continent's decline in agricultural productivity over the past six decades was \"a stark reminder for the urgent need for adaptation\", Ruto said . His spokesperson, Hussein Mohammed, had yet to respond to our request for the president's evidence for this claim at time of publication. Go Shimada is a professor at Meiji University in Japan, where he also edits a journal on international development. In 2022, he studied the impact of climate change-related disasters on Africa's growth and agriculture. We asked him about productivity. It was \"ratio of output to input,\" he said. \"The output is the agricultural production quantity.\" Shimada said agricultural inputs are the external resources used in crop and livestock production to increase yields. These include labour, fertiliser, seeds, pesticides, technology and water. Extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods, rising energy costs, and rising temperatures affect agricultural production. For the data to verify this claim, Shimada referred us to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations (UN) agency that deals with weather, water and climate. UN agencies back up claim The WMO told Africa Check that the statistic comes from a 2022 assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC is a scientific body set up in 1988 to guide research into dealing with climate change. \"Climate change has reduced total agricultural productivity growth in Africa by 34% since 1961, more than in any other region,\" the report said , citing a 2021 paper in the journal Nature. The paper , titled Anthropogenic climate change has slowed global agricultural productivity growth, used data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), another UN agency. The WMO also provided us with a factsheet that repeated the statistic, predicting that \"future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress\". Prof Ariel Ortiz-Bobea co-authored the journal article. He is an economist at Cornell University in the US and researches agricultural sustainability. When his paper was published, he wrote a series of social media posts explaining the study and made the data and the code available for other researchers to review. The data covers 47 countries in Africa as classified by the FAO. The remaining seven countries in North Africa are not included in the agency's \"Africa\" designation. We have contacted Ortiz-Bobea for more context. But Ruto's claim is backed up by credible publicly available data and we rate it correct. Kenya is an example of what's possible in renewable and reliable energy, said Ruto. He put the national grid \u2013 generation, transmission and distribution \u2013 at three gigawatts (GW). A watt is a unit of power, and there are a billion watts in every gigawatt. According to one estimate , one GW of electricity has the same power as 1.3 million horses or 100 million light-emitting diode (LED) light bulbs. Kenya's national statistics agency regularly publishes figures on power generation. These come from Kenya Power , the country's electricity utility, and KenGen , the power-generating company. The agency's data usually shows the \"installed capacity\", defined as the theoretical maximum power output the power system is designed to operate at, and \"effective capacity\", which is the maximum power output when the system is operating under existing constraints. This is measured in megawatts (MW). There are a thousand megawatts in every gigawatt. Different data sources support claim The latest data from the agency showed that the country's installed capacity increased from 2989.6 MW in 2021 to a preliminary figure of 3,321.3 MW in 2022. The effective capacity also increased from 2,857.6 MW to a provisional figure of 2,857.6 MW. The latest public data from Kenya Power, released in January 2023, showed the country had 3,078 MW on its grid as of 30 June 2022. The regulator, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra), also published data showing that the installed capacity of the grid as of 31 December was 3,321 MW, while the effective capacity was 3,041 MW. Publicly available data supports Ruto's claim that Kenya's grid is operating at an estimated 3 GW. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Renewable energy is generated from naturally replenishing sources. These sources include geothermal, wind, solar and hydroelectric power. Ruto said 93% of the electricity from the national grid is renewable. The latest Epra generation statistics cover the second half of 2022. They show that renewables account for 73.5% of total installed capacity, and 76.3% of total effective capacity on the grid. ( Note: See our calculations here .) The report also noted : \"87.42% of the energy generated in Kenya was obtained from renewable energy resources.\" Source: Epra Kenya Power's most recent annual report shows that out of a total of 12,653 gigawatt-hours (gWh) of power bought in the year ending 30 June 2022, 84.3% or 10,667 gWh came from renewable sources. We have not seen any data to support Ruto's claim that 93% of Kenya's electricity comes from renewable sources. We rate the claim incorrect. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is the global body that provides insight and analysis on energy issues. For data and how access is defined, the agency told Africa Check to look at the 2023 Guidebook for improved electricity access statistics . The agency defines access to electricity as a household having enough electricity for basic needs such as lighting, charging phones, and a radio, which equates to about 50 to 75 kilowatt-hours per household per year. \"Households connected to national grids and mini-grids are considered to have access\" because they can meet this requirement. The report specifically notes that 600 million people in Africa have no access to electricity. It cites the 2022 Africa Energy Outlook , a report produced together with organisations such as the African Union. \"In 2021, 43% of the population of Africa, around 600 million people, still lacked access to electricity,\" the report noted . We cross-referenced the IEA data with the world development indicators database curated by the World Bank . The data showed that 50.6% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity in 2021, when the population was 1.18 billion . With 49.4% without electricity, this is 597 million people. However, there are 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Djibouti is not included as \"it is handled administratively as part of the Middle East and North Africa\". Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are other African countries not included. Data for the six countries shows that they account for nearly 2.5 million people without electricity, bringing the total number of people without electricity in Africa to nearly 600 million people. Dr Leonardo Rocha Souza, the chief of the energy statistics division in the department of economic and social affairs in the UN, told Africa Check to check the figures against the energy progress report , which tracks the sustainable development goal on access to energy. The tracker showed that in 2021, 50% of sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 or about 590 million people \u2013 had access to electricity. The other half did not. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Clean cooking access is when a household reliably uses cooking methods such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), electricity, bioethanol or biogas that minimise harmful pollutants. The IEA shared its clean cooking report with us to verify the figure. \"Today, 1 billion people on the continent \u2013 roughly four in every five \u2013 rely on highly polluting cooking fuels used in open fires or basic stoves,\" says the July 2023 report . Almost half of these people live in just five countries: Nigeria, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Uganda. Souza, the UN statistics division chief, also sent us data showing that in sub-Saharan Africa, only 17.7% of the population, or about 208 million people, had access to clean cooking energy in 2021. That leaves nearly a billion people without. The latest recent World Bank data shows that in 2021 only 19%, or 224 million of the 1.18 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa, had access to clean cooking energy. That left about 956 million without access. In Djibouti, only 10% of the total population of 1.1 million in 2021, or 110,000 people, had access to clean cooking energy. In Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia, 100% of the population has access to clean cooking energy. Morocco is at 98%, leaving only 741,432 people without access in 2021. ( Note: No data is available for Libya .) On the basis of all these figures, we consider this claim to be correct. Ruto said of the estimate: \"These are not just numbers, these are 30 million opportunities to build our future, 30 million dreams that can be fulfilled through climate-proof avenues of growth and 30 million steps towards shared prosperity.\" Dr Louise Fox is a non-resident senior fellow at the US-based global policy thinktank, the Brookings Institution , and has written extensively on labour and jobs in Africa. She was previously chief economist at the US Agency for International Development . Fox co-authored a book in 2014, Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa , which predicted that the continent's labour force would grow \"by 11 million people per year over the next 10 years\". In 2021, she explained why the high number of annual jobs needed on the continent was \"misleading\". The main reason, Fox argued in a commentary for Brookings, was that the annual increase in the working-age population was misinterpreted as an increase in the labour force. \"But not everybody of working-age participates in the labour force. And it is the labour force \u2013 those who are employed plus those looking for work (unemployed ) \u2013 who need jobs,\" she wrote. The working age population is the number of people aged 15 and over, but most 15-year-olds are usually still at school and not available for work. Issue not so much number of jobs, as quality of jobs, says expert We contacted Fox, who shared a policy paper she co-authored in 2021 and a document from the African Development Bank . The document puts the number of young people entering the labour market in Africa at 11 to 12 million every year. For up to date figures, she asked us to check with the International Labour Organization . The UN agency's key report, World Employment and Social Outlook 2023 , showed that Africa's labour force increased by an average of 14.65 million people between 2019 and 2023. \"The issue is not so much 'how many jobs are needed', but how can countries create better jobs for both youth entering the labour market and the older cohorts,\" Fox told Africa Check. In her view, the key issues, which she discussed in her 2021 paper , were: how to keep people in school so that they enter the labour force with the right skills, especially women up to the age of 18 job quality (or the \"missing jobs\" challenge) The available data does not support Ruto's claim. Ruto described the cost of capital as \"the most prohibitive barrier\" to Africa's progress. \"Private investors charge high premiums driven by both real but mostly perceived risks,\" he said . \"It is not a secret that we are paying at least five times as much as advanced economies to borrow from the financial markets. It's a fact, documented.\" We found a similar claim in a speech by the secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , UNCTAD. The speech was given in Nairobi on 16 August 2023. \"... we should remember that African countries pay four times more for borrowing than the US and eight times more than European countries,\" said UNCTAD boss Rebeca Grynspan . The UN agency referred Africa Check to its July 2023 report , A World of Debt. The report shows that while Germany borrowed at 1.5% interest rates and the US borrowed at 3.1%, Africa borrowed on average at 11.6% from the global financial markets. \"Countries in Africa borrow on average at rates that are four times higher than those of the United States and even eight times higher than those of Germany,\" reads the report. It continued: \"High borrowing costs make it difficult for developing countries to fund important investments, which in turn further undermines debt sustainability and progress towards sustainable development,\" A 2015 journal article examining the borrowing rates of African countries found that these countries paid unexplained \"higher-than-normal coupon rates\" on private sovereign bond markets. Higher interest rates attributed to investor bias against Africa \"Higher coupon payments that cannot be explained by observable measures of risk can only be attributed to investor bias against African governments,\" says a policy brief of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (Uneca). The author of the brief, Dr Nadia Ouedraogo , referred Africa Check to this 2023 Uneca paper on debt and finance in Africa as the source of her data. She said the risk premium paid by African countries was influenced by various factors, including their overall economic situation, their governing institutions and their ability to repay debts. The study accounted \"for all these different variables and found that the African countries pay a higher premium\" which couldn't be justified by these criteria alone. Instead, it appeared to be influenced by less clear-cut, potentially subjective factors, Ouedraogo said. Ruto's claim is backed by the evidence, we therefore rate it correct.",

        "doc": "Most of the president's claims were accurate, including the number of houses built by the government between 1994 and 2019, how many people today have access to water and improved sanitation, and an improvement in the number of bachelor passes in no-fee schools. However, his claims about the number of university students helped by the government's financial aid scheme were either understated or unproven, and he was wrong about how many South Africans accessed clean drinking water in 1994. Like our previous report on claims made at the launch of the ANC's manifesto review, some of the numbers shared tended to over-inflate the progress made under the party's rule. As South Africa moves towards national elections in 2024, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) is asking the public to take a hard look at its record. The party will be touring the country in September and October 2023, trying to convince voters that it has made progress in key areas such as the economy, social change and corruption. The process is being tagged as the \"#2019ANCElectionManifestoReview\" on social media. At the launch of the review in Gauteng province on 4 September, president Cyril Ramaphosa made several claims, some of which we fact-checked in our first report here . We found that he inflated the number of South Africans on social grants in the present and understated the number who received grants in 1994, giving the impression that the increase was greater than it was. Similarly, we found no evidence that only 36% of South Africans had access to electricity in 1994 \u2013 the figures suggest it was closer to 53% \u2013 making 92% connected in 2023 less of an achievement. In this second report, we highlight other claims that hit or missed the mark. This claim appears in the published transcript of Ramaphosa's speech. The Department of Human Settlements (DHS) is responsible for building government-funded housing. But it does not keep a record of new houses built since 1994, instead providing each year's progress in annual reports . However, in 2019 the department gave Africa Check a count of new housing built since 1994. This showed that a total of 3,263,331 new housing units had been built by December 2018. Ramaphosa's claim that 3.2 million new houses were built between 1994 and 2019 is therefore correct. But what has happened since? In the live version of his speech, speaking in Sotho, Ramaphosa said that since 1994 \"government has built more than 3.5 million houses\". This would mean that an additional 300,000 houses were built between 2019 and September 2023. Here's where things get a little unclear. The tally provided to Africa Check in 2019 included totals for each financial year (a period from April of one year to March of the next), and for houses already built by December 2018 (58,394). The tally did not include the number of houses built in the remainder of the 2018/19 financial year. We could start with the total up to the start of 2018/19 \u2013 3,204,937 \u2013 and add the numbers published in each DHS annual report thereafter. But the 2018/19 annual report did not include a figure for the number of houses built that year. It only said that \"9 provinces were supported in implementing the subsidy housing programme\". According to the following year's report , 58,721 housing units were completed in 2019/20. Adding 45,551 houses built in 2020/21 and 28,351 in 2021/22 to this gives a total of 3,395,954 houses built since 1994. This includes houses built between April and December 2018, but the actual total for the 2018/19 financial year is unknown.  This total falls short of the 3.5 million claimed by Ramaphosa. It is possible that unpublished data matches this figure. The DHS 2022/23 annual report has also not yet been published. Without this information, we rate the claim unproven. Adding to the list of improvements in living conditions, Ramaphosa's published transcript includes the claim that in \"1994, only 6 out of 10 South Africans had access to clean drinking water\". Statistics South Africa, or Stats SA, the country's data agency, has some data on access to water in the 1990s. For example, the 1995 October Household Survey found that 78.5% of households had access to clean water. This refers to piped water inside the dwelling or on the property, or from a communal tap or tank. According to the survey, 10% of households accessed water from boreholes and rainwater tanks, while 11.4% obtained water from rivers, streams and dams. But Stats SA said that the survey had several limitations. The 1996 census found that 81% of households had access to piped water. A smaller nationally representative survey, conducted by the Southern Africa Labour Development Research Unit in late 1993 and early 1994, found that 76.4% of households had access to piped water. Almost 100% of white, coloured and Indian households had access, but only 67% of (black) African households. Prof Ingrid Woolard, dean of the faculty of economic and management sciences at Stellenbosch University, previously told Africa Check that the survey was \"fairly reliable, but small \u2013 less than 9,000 households \u2013 so there will be some margin of error\". All data sources point to more than 60% of  South Africans having access to water in 1994. Stats SA's most recent general household survey (GHS), published in August 2023, found that an estimated 46.6% of households had access to piped water in their dwellings in 2022, 28.3% accessed water on site or in a yard, while 12.5% relied on communal taps and 1.7% relied on neighbours' taps. The total was 89.1%. \"Although generally households' access to water improved, 3% of households still had to fetch water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools, dams, wells and springs in 2022,\" Stats SA noted. While Ramaphosa's claim is correct, Ni\u00ebl Roux, director of service delivery statistics at Stats SA, has previously cautioned against comparing data from the 1990s with more recent figures. For example, \"whereas access to water is asked in one question in the GHS, two questions are used in the census\", he said. The GHS asks about the main source of drinking water in the household. The census asks about access to piped water and the main source of water for household use. According to Stats SA , improved sanitation refers to \"flush toilets connected to a public sewerage system or a septic tank, or a pit toilet with a ventilation pipe\". The data agency's latest GHS shows that in 2022, 83.2% of South Africans had access to \"improved sanitation\". This was eight out of 10 people, as Ramaphosa said. The Western Cape province recorded the highest level of access, at 95.9% , followed by Gauteng at 90.5% and the Eastern Cape at 90% . The lowest levels of access were recorded in Limpopo (63.1%) and Mpumalanga (63.8%) . Ramaphosa was also correct that two out of three South Africans had access to flush toilets. In percentage terms, the figure was 65.8% in 2022. According to the latest GHS from Stats SA, about 51.6 million people were not covered by private medical aid in 2022. Around 9.7 million were covered. As Africa Check has previously reported , this doesn't necessarily represent a clear divide between people who have access to private healthcare and those who don't. Many people use both. The 2022 GHS also asked households which type of healthcare facility they would first consult if a family member fell ill or was injured. Overall, \"73% of households said that they would first go to public clinics, hospitals or other public institutions, while 25.5% of households said that they would first consult a private doctor, private clinic or hospital\". This suggests that many people without private medical coverage still primarily use private healthcare services. And those who do use public health services do not necessarily receive adequate care. Public health services in South Africa often face challenges such as understaffing and underfunding. \"No-fee\" schools are public schools that do not collect school fees. The fee-paying status of schools is \"based on the economic level of the community around the school\", according to the Department of Basic Education (DBE). A bachelor's pass is the minimum grade 12 qualification required to apply for a university degree. Grade 12 is the final year of high school in South Africa. The DBE referred Africa Check to their annual reports for grade 12 examinations results, including statistics on pass levels. The 2019 report showed that out of a total of 186,058 bachelor's passes in that year, 96,976 came from learners at \"no-fee\" schools. This is 52.1% of the total proportion of bachelor's passes. At the time of publishing, we had not received a response to questions about the figures not totalling 55%, although this was the percentage given previously by the basic education minister. The 2022 DBE report broke down bachelor's passes into those from learners at fee-paying, no-fee and independent schools. Of a total of 278,814 bachelor's passes, 93,899 (or 33.7%) came from fee-paying schools, 169,903 (or 64%) came from no-fee schools and 15,012 (or 5.4%) came from independent schools. While Ramaphosa claimed in his speech that the number of students funded by Nsfas in 2018 was 480,000, the published transcript put the number at 580,000 . Africa Check contacted the ANC for clarification but did not receive a response. Nsfas is a government scheme established to provide financial assistance to students who cannot afford to study at technical vocational education and training (Tvet) colleges and public universities. According to their 2018 annual report, the scheme funded 247,769 students from Tvet colleges and 393,781 students from universities. This makes a total of 641,550 students. Ramaphosa missed the opportunity to claim a greater achievement. The ANC's Febe Potgieter directed us to the Department of Higher Education and Training's (DHET) 2022/23 annual performance plan as the source of the data for this claim. But according to the DHET, the source for their funding statistics was in turn Nsfas. The DHET also explained that their reporting showed data \"for the academic year preceding the financial year under review\". The DHET's data for \"2021/22\" therefore refers to the 2020 academic year and not the 2021 academic year. Nsfas missed the September 2022 deadline to submit its 2021/22 annual report, which would include data on 2021 funding. At the time of publishing, the report was still not available on their website. In a 2021 funding status report, Nsfas said that it had distributed funds to 623,386 students as of 23 June 2021. Africa Check contacted Nsfas for clarification. Without a response, we rate the claim as unproven. The Covid-19 temporary employment relief scheme (better known as Covid-19 Ters or just \"Ters\") was introduced in March 2020 to subsidise the wages of people whose employment was threatened by the pandemic. It has since been extended several times, the last time until July 2021 . Covid-19 Ters was implemented through the existing unemployment insurance fund (UIF) which provides similar support in other situations where employment is threatened. Ramaphosa's figures are in line with information published by labour minister Thulas Nxesi in April 2022. In a press release , Nxesi said R64 billion had been paid to 5.7 million workers. However, some people were paid in error. In a 2020 report, the auditor general of South Africa (Agsa) found that there were several \"control weaknesses\" in the administration of the payments. The Agsa identified payments to people already receiving other forms of financial support, to employees of the UIF, and to people not eligible to receive Ters (for example, because they had died). According to Nxesi, the labour department has worked with banks and other government departments to validate at least 5 million identity numbers to avoid fraudulent payments.",

But that's not true, the protest took place in 2021. A video circulating on Facebook in October 2023 claims to show OPay agents protesting at the company's offices in Lagos, Nigeria, over \"unauthorised withdrawals\" from their accounts. The video's caption reads : \"Monies a re being moved unauthorized from Opay accounts, cries from agents.\" The video shows a news anchor speaking, with the logo of TVC News in the background and top left corner of the video. It then moves to a reporter outside OPay offices who speaks to some of the affected agents. OPay is a mobile-based financial services provider. Its agents can offer services directly to customers in their area through OPay point of sale. TVC News is a 24-hour TV channel based in Lagos. The video could affect the company's credibility and potentially cause panic among Nigerians who use the platform. Similar posts can be found here and here . But does the video show OPay agents protesting in October 2023? We checked. Old news We found the same video on TVC's YouTube channel. It was posted on 24 August 2021 with the caption: \"OPAY Agents Protest 'Unauthorised' Fund Withdrawal, Demand Urgent Intervention.\" OPay also took to its official Facebook page on 1 October 2023 to assure its clients that their funds were safe, saying the video was old. \"Our attention has been drawn to a certain old video that resurfaced on some social media platforms regarding alleged fraudulent activities on some OPay agent accounts. We wish to state that the allegations are dated and have been resolved,\" reads part of the statement. The video does not show OPay agents protesting in October 2023. The event took place in 2021.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: A Facebook page that first used a local rapper's name is offering Nigerians a lot of money if they like and share a video. This is a tactic known as engagement bait and the goal is to get greater reach. Ignore the account's posts. The Facebook page Young king is offering N500,000 (about US$644) to Nigerians for engaging with some of its posts. Its 16 September 2023 post reads : \"Anyone that watching my video and like & share it I'm going to paid that person 500k Olamide badoo.\" The post has attracted more than 130 comments and over 600 likes. But can the page be trusted? We checked. Engagement bait to increase reach According to its page transparency section, the page was created on 8 May 2023 and first named \"Olamide badoo\". It used the name of popular Nigerian rapper and singer Olamide Adedeji , popularly known as Badoo. It then changed its name to \"Young king\" on 2 October, but continued to post the rapper's photos and videos. It's unlikely that a celebrity would change the name of their social media account, as it might confuse their fans. This is much more characteristic of a fake account impersonating a celebrity. The artist's official page is Olamide . It was created on 26 July 2015, has over 3 million followers and is verified by Meta . While the suspicious page also has a relatively large following, with over 142,000 followers, it does not carry the blue tick verification badge . The suspicious page asks users to share and like a video to receive the money. This is a common tactic known as engagement bait , which is aimed at increasing the post's reach. Arguably this tactic is working, as the page has attracted followers quickly. We also couldn't find any similar posts on the rapper's official page. There is no proof that the suspicious page is in any way linked to the rapper. For more tips, read our guide to Facebook scams and how to spot them.",

The claim has also appeared on Facebook here , here and here . But is this a legitimate recruitment by the Nigerian Navy ? We checked. Ignore website ran by 'swindlers' On 11 September 2023, the navy shared the posts on its official X account, and stamped them \"fake news\". On the same day , the director of naval information, Adedotun Ayo-Vaughan, told the national daily Vanguard that the navy's vacancies could be found on its official website https://www.navy.mil.ng . \"It is important to note that the Nigerian navy did not announce any DSSC Enlistment Exercise neither is the Service conducting any form of enlistment for the Nigerian Navy officer cadre,\" he said . He described those running the questionable website as \"criminals\" and \"swindlers\". Despite this, the website in question continues to be shared online. The public should always verify information through the Nigerian Navy official website and its social media handles to avoid falling prey to fraudsters, Ayo-Vaughan said .",

But they promise users thousands of Kenyan shillings as rewards. The accounts have posted on different dates here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the accounts and the offers to be trusted? We checked. Common fraud tactic in Kenya Africa Check noted that while the accounts use different photos of Hassan and even have different adaptations of her name, all use the same phone number \"0735110472\" to engage users on WhatsApp. We reached out to the number and enquired about the offers.

In such situations, scammers get away with the user's money and never reward them. The promotions on the suspicious accounts do not appear on Hassan's official Facebook page , which has over 1.4 million followers. We also checked her verified Instagram account , which has over 1.5 million followers, and could not find the promotions. Africa Check has previously debunked such accounts using Hassan's name here , here and here . The accounts and the offers are fake.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Tanzanian actor Othman Njaidi is well known in the Kenyan entertainment industry. We expose three Facebook accounts using his name to run bogus promotions. Three Facebook accounts Jabali Gifts , Junior J J Jabali and Jabali Junior Ke have been running what appear to be promotions on different Facebook groups. \"Jabali\" is the stage name of Tanzanian actor Othman Njaidi, also known as Patrick Kanumba. He played the lead character, Jabali Junior, in Kenya's popular TV drama series Sultana. Two of the accounts use his photos as their profile pictures. The accounts post simple questions and encourage users to answer. The users are then told they've won and are asked to contact the accounts privately to claim their money. The questions are almost similar and, for instance, ask users to name their favourite local actors, their county or even identify words starting with certain letters of the alphabet. The posts appear here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the accounts and the offers to be trusted? We checked. Fake accounts, scam offers The posts are poorly written and contain odd punctuation. This is usually a sign of an imposter account. Celebrities usually strive to communicate to their fans clearly and concisely. Another red flag is the thousands of Kenyan shillings promised to users for answering questions that would require very little effort to answer. It would be odd to give many strangers on Facebook KSh45,000 (US$300) for simply naming their counties of residence or answering similarly easy questions. Each of the accounts rarely post on their own timelines. Little to no activity on a Facebook account's timeline is usually another sign that it's fake. One of the accounts told us to pay an \"unlocking\" fee of KSh699 to receive KSh55,000. If you are asked to pay any kind of fee before you receive your winnings, this is a clear sign that a competition or promotion is run by a scammer. We looked at Njaidi's Instagram account , which has over 300,000 followers, and found no offers like those on the suspicious Facebook accounts. All signs point to fake Facebook accounts attempting to scam the actor's fans.",

But the individual shown was detained in 2022 and was the former president of Gabon's national assembly. A video doing the rounds on social media since August 2023 claims to show Gabon's former senate president trying to escape the country with suitcases full of money. The video began circulating during and after the country's 26 August election period and the subsequent military coup . It shows a grey-haired man trying to prevent uniformed men from opening a suitcase on an open pick-up truck. There are several suitcases on the truck bed. Despite the man's efforts, the uniformed men go ahead and open the suitcases, revealing stacks of cash inside. A few onlookers can be seen capturing the incident on their mobile phones. The video is captioned: \"Former senate president of Gabon was arrested with a huge amount of CFA currency trying to escape from his country.\" It has been reposted several times, including here , here , here , here , here and here . Jointly, the posts have garnered over one million views. The Gabon coup Following the controversial re-election of Ali Bongo for a third term as president, he was overthrown in a military coup on 30 August. The coup leader, Brice Oligui Nguema , was named the transitional president of the country. The coup has been internationally condemned , including by the United Nations . It has also raised concerns about the credibility of the disputed earlier elections. Following the coup, the African Union suspended Gabon's membership. Recent coups in African countries Since 2020, coups have taken place in seven African countries . All but Sudan were once French colonies. Experts have pointed to rising anti-French sentiment in former colonies as one of the factors contributing to the coups, alongside other reasons such as poverty, poor governance and ineffective civil society. The video, which supposedly shows a senior political leader attempting to leave the country with bags of money, may be more worrying given its increased circulation around the time of the disputed election and subsequent coup. But what does the video show? We checked. Incident happened in 2022 A reverse image search of the video's keyframes reveals that the incident took place in September 2022 and shows Guy Nzouba Ndama, a former speaker of Gabon's national assembly. Rather than fleeing the country, he was returning to Gabon from neighbouring Republic of the Congo with an estimated US$2 million in CFA francs. Ndama was at the time also president of the opposition party the Democrats . He was arrested and later placed under house arrest on charges of violating import controls and conspiring with a foreign power. Both the former and current senate presidents are women, with Lucie Milebou Aubusson succeeding Rose Francine Rogomb\u00e9. Claims that the video shows the arrest of a former Gabonese senate president and that the arrest was in 2023 are false.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: The video was fabricated using artificial intelligence, and has been debunked by multiple experts. The country's ruling party also confirmed it was a fake, and Zambian police launched an investigation into the video's creator. The president has not made any announcement that he will not run in the 2026 election. Posts circulating on social media in October 2023 claim to show a video of Zambian president Hakainde Hichilema announcing that he will not run for re-election. Zambia next goes to the polls in 2026 . Hichilema has been in power since 2021 , when his United Party for National Development (UPND) won a landslide election against then-president Edgar Lungu. One version of the claim was posted by an account on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that appeared to be linked to Ghanaian politician Samuel Koku Anyidoho . It received more than 5,000 views. The video was also posted on Facebook here and here , on X here , here and here , and on YouTube here , here and here . But not all viewers were convinced, with many comments calling the video \"fake\". We looked into its authenticity and here's what we found. Video debunked by various fact-checking organisations Some versions of the video circulating on social media include a watermark linking to a TikTok account, @zambian_ai . This account has posted a handful of videos seemingly showing Zambian politicians, though the one doing the rounds on other social media platforms, which had been played over 77,000 times , appears to have been deleted. In the video, Hichilema appears to say: \"It is with the utmost sincerity and a profound sense of duty to our great nation that I announce my decision to not seek re-election in the upcoming general elections of 2026.\" He goes on: \"I believe this decision is in the best interests of our country and its future.\" But whatever resemblance the person in the video bears to the Zambian president, the footage is not authentic and has been digitally manipulated. Fact-checking organisations have published articles debunking the video, including AFP here and PesaCheck here . Other media outlets also weighed in, here , here , here and here . Watch out for telltale signs of digital manipulation As some commenters pointed out , there are visual clues that the video is fake. For example, only the president's face appears to move in the video, with the rest of his body staying still. This is a clue that the video was made by generating an animated version of the face, overlaid onto a still image of the president. This was confirmed to AFP by experts in digital forensics. These experts also noted that the human figure's teeth are \"misformed\" in some frames, another sign that it has been fabricated. This is because \"the mouth and teeth are synthesised to be consistent with an audio track\", digital forensics expert Hany Farid told AFP. Other experts used specialised software to analyse the video and confirmed that it had been edited. They showed exactly which parts of the frame had been falsified and suggested that the editing of the video was not very advanced but had likely been done with easy-to-use tools, creating something more closely resembling a \" cheap fake\" than a true deepfake . The Zambian police told AFP that they were \"investigating the origin of the video\". The secretary general of the UPND, Batuke Imenda , also said the video was fake in a statement posted to social media. He implied members of the opposition had created it. The president has not announced that he won't run for re-election in 2026. Read our guide on spotting AI-generated content online here .

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Fake news graphics are becoming common on Kenyan social media. A graphic supposedly quoting president William Ruto about the pay of public servants is fabricated. A graphic circulating on social media in October 2023 attributes a startling quote about civil servants' pay to Kenya's president William Ruto . The graphic , dated 27 October, reads: \"I am asking all public and civil servants, to allow me to use the November salary as tax. We use that money to boost our economy.\" It also has Ruto's picture as well as a Kenyans.co.ke branding on the top right corner, making it look like it was published by the popular Kenyan news website. Since taking office, Ruto has embarked on a major and at times unpopular drive to raise taxes. Many Kenyans have been unhappy with the tax increases, although Ruto has justified them as the only way to reduce borrowing for a government struggling with high public debt. Claims on social media that Ruto wants to take the entire November 2023 salary of civil servants have gained traction. The graphic was published here , here , here , here and here . But is it legit? Graphic and quote are fake Africa Check searched Google for the quote attributed to Ruto and came up empty. Such a statement would be widely reported in Kenya as taxation is a much-debated topic in the country. The graphic also doesn't appear on Kenyans.co.ke's website , Facebook or X pages, where it posts its latest news. On 31 October, the site posted the graphic \u2013 stamped \"FAKE\" \u2013 on its official X account, warning readers. \"This post did not emanate from our media house. We flag it as FAKE. For official communication from http://Kenyans.co.ke , always visit the official website and verified social media pages,\" the news agency wrote . The graphic has been fabricated.",

But there's no record of the company on Nigeria's business registry. A Facebook post is encouraging users to grow their money through a \"wonderful\" investment platform called Sure Grace. The 20 October 2023 post reads : \"THIS HOW IT WORKS, IT IS A PROCSS WHEREBY YOU PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO THEM AND AFTER 45MINUTES THEY WOULD PAY YOU DOUBLE. I PAID 50,000 AND THEY PAID ME 100,000.\" The poorly written post provides a WhatsApp link for users who are interested in investing in the platform. Perhaps to convince users of the platform's legitimacy, the post also features screenshots of what appears to be proof of payment from \"Sure Grace Investment Platform\". We also found similar posts here , here and here . But is the investment platform legit? We checked. Signs of a scam The investment platform appears to have no online presence \u2013 no website and no official social media accounts. We would expect a legitimate business to have a functioning website and verified social media accounts where it engages with customers. The promise of high profits in no time, in this case double the investment in just 45 minutes, is a sign that the platform can't be trusted. Such a business is unsustainable. The post asks potential investors to reach out to \"admin\" via WhatsApp. This is another red flag as scammers often use this method to steal users' personal information. We clicked on the WhatApp link provided and it led us to an account apparently in the name of \"HON IDRIS IBRAHIM\". We were also prompted with an automated message to initiate the conversation: \" GOOD DAY SIR AM INTERESTED IN THE OPAY INVESTMENT PLATFORM HOW CAN SOMEONE INVEST NOW???\" This is suspicious because the Facebook post makes no mention of OPay Investment Platform. Africa Check has previously investigated Facebook posts and accounts using OPay's name here and here , and found them to be scams. OPay is a mobile money platform headquartered in Nigeria. Africa Check searched for \"Sure Grace Investment\" on Nigeria's business registry and came up empty . This is a sign that it might be operating without a licence, or simply doesn't exist.

        "doc": "Ruto is right that the budget for the judiciary has increased by KSh3 billion a year under his watch. But he misled on the cost of the staple food, maize flour, and understated by KSh1.8 billion how much Kenya's public universities are in debt. The president was wildly off the mark when it came to how many more Kenyans were enrolled at teacher training colleges and we could find no proof for his claim that his administration has employed 20,000 new healthcare workers. On 9 November 2023, Kenyan president William Ruto delivered his state of the nation address in parliament . Seeking to show progress amid a gloomy economic outlook , Ruto told lawmakers that his government had been working on an \"urgent transformation\" of the country. He listed the steps he had taken to boost the economy, create jobs, reform health and agriculture and to improve governance. We looked at five claims he made. We contacted State House spokesperson Hussein Mohamed for the president's evidence for the claims and will update this report when we hear back. Ruto said that this was one of the first steps he took on his \"first day on duty\". In his inauguration speech on 13 September 2022, Ruto pledged to increase the budget for the Kenyan judiciary by KSh3 billion a year over the next five years. The budget process is the responsibility of the national assembly . All money is spent according to the Appropriations Act , the law that authorises the withdrawal of public funds. Ruto's predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta signed the bill into law on 21 June 2022 , and it came into effect on 1 July. The appropriations law allocated KSh16.4 billion (about US$141 million then ) to the judiciary and KSh587 million to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), the administrative arm of the judiciary. In February 2023, the national assembly's budget committee acknowledged an additional KSh2.84 billion for the judiciary to \"cater mainly for operations and maintenance\". This increase from KSh16.4 billion to KSh19.23 billion was also recorded in the controller of budget 's annual report for 2022/23 . The JSC also received an increase of KSh300 million , from KSh590 million to KSh800 million. The total increase for the judiciary in that financial year was therefore KSh3.13 billion. On 26 June Ruto signed the latest appropriations law . This allocated KSh22.3 billion ($159 million) to the judiciary, with KSh20.4 billion for recurrent expenses and KSh1.85 billion for capital expenditure. This is an increase of KSh3.1 billion over the 2022/23 budget. The JSC received KSh896 million. The judicial budget has increased by at least KSh6 billion in the last two fiscal years. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Ruto has been under pressure to reduce the cost of living . In his speech, he cited changes in the price of maize flour, Kenya's staple food, as an indicator that his plan to subsidise fertiliser and increase production was working. To verify this claim, Africa Check checked with four supermarkets that stock a total of 14 brands of maize flour. At Carrefour supermarket, one of the largest supermarket chains in the country, we bought nine brands of flour, with the lowest priced at KSh132 and the highest at KSh270. However, the cheapest brand was on sale and usually sells for KSh179 . Retailers often mark down the prices of fast-moving items closer to their expiry date to avoid wastage. At Naivas supermarket , another major chain, prices ranged from KSh157 to KSh270 . And at Chandarana supermarket, prices ranged from KSh152 to KSh230 , while at Quickmart , they were between KSh152 and KSh230 . A spot check the day after the speech by Citizen TV , the country's most-watched television station, showed that maize prices had not fallen as the president claimed. The station interviewed farmers who put the price of unmilled maize at between KSh100 and KSh170 for a two kilogram tin. The president's figures do not reflect market prices. While some brands of maize flour are sold close to his lower price point, the highest prices are significantly higher than his band. We rate his claim as misleading. ( See how we rate claims .) Ruto said Kenya's public universities were saddled with debt, and he had sat down with all the vice-chancellors to work out how to fund the institutions of higher learning. A June 2023 report by the Presidential Working Party on Education Reforms showed that, as of December 2022, universities had outstanding bills of KSh61.8 billion . This figure was available to the president at the time of his speech, meaning he understated the debt. The report said this was because universities had \"been unable to raise adequate income to support their operations\". Kenyan law has established the universities fund to manage funding for public universities. Africa Check reached out to the fund for the most recent figures. We'll update this report when we hear back. The sharp increase was due to \"changes to the entry requirements for teacher training colleges\", Ruto said . Kenya's national statistics bureau publishes annual enrolment figures for teacher trainees in its flagship economic survey. Its most recent put their number at 17,984 in 2022 and 16,429 in 2021. So a jump from 17,984 in the economic survey to 20,456 in the president's speech is an increase of 2,472 or 13.7%, not 300%. The president's figures are completely wrong. Kenya has recruited 20,000 new healthcare workers, the president said . In November 2022, the non-partisan Parliamentary Budget Office published a report detailing the cost implications of employing these workers over five years. The figure also appeared in the February 2023 budget policy statement , in which the government said it wanted to \"prioritise the employment of 20,000 health workers\". These included doctors, nurses, clinical officers, lab technologists and physiotherapists. But we haven't seen any data to support the claim that the government has actually contracted these workers. In December 2022, the health ministry informed the national treasury that the first phase of hiring 6,600 of 20,000 health workers was an \"unfunded priority\". In a press conference in April 2023 , the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) demanded that a \"budget should be set aside for annual recruitment of 20,000 additional healthcare workers as promised to Kenyans\". In August, officials from KMPDU and the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers advocated for the recruitment of 12,000 health workers annually. We rate this claim as unproven.",

The post asks interested users to contact \"admin\" via the WhatsApp link attached. Similar Facebook posts can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is the investment platform legit? We checked. Signs of a scam We contacted the \"admin\" through the WhatsApp link provided and were assured that we would be credited with double our investment \"in less than 45 minutes to an hour\". We said we were interested in investing N50,000 . To register , we were asked to provide our bank name, account number, mobile phone number and method of payment. Despite submitting false information, we received a message saying: \"Congratulations your registration was successful now.\" We were then provided with the bank details of \"Bassey Junior\" to make the deposit. Nigeria's anti-corruption agency has previously warned the public not to invest in platforms that promise large returns in no time. Such businesses often end up being unable to pay every investor the promised returns. The \"admin\" also used words like \"quickly\" and \"now\" several times, as if we were being rushed into investing. This made us suspect that if we made the payment, they would stop responding to our messages and disappear with our money. Additionally, a search on Nigeria's business register brought up an inactive company named \"Omega-Pro Global Investment Company\", but not \"Omega Pro Investment\". An unregistered company is another red flag that a social media post is a scam. The poorly written post is also a sign that the platform cannot be trusted, as we would expect legitimate businesses to publish well-written content. Africa Check has previously investigated similar suspicious investment schemes here , here , here , here and here .

        "doc": "IN SHORT : Russia claims it invaded Ukraine to \"denazify\" its neighbour. But after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in the Canadian parliament when the house speaker honoured a man who had fought under the Nazis, his country did not issue a stamp with the man's face on it. \"The Ukrainian Postal Service is now issuing stamps with the face of the WW2 Wafen SS Nazi Galicia cretin Yaroslav Hunko.\" That's the caption to an image circulating on social media in several African countries since late September 2023 . The image seems to be a commemorative postage stamp set : an envelope with a stamp. The envelope shows a photo of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the words \"HEROES DON'T DIE\". The stamp itself is a portrait of Yaroslav Hunka , who is 98 years old in 2023. In the second world war Hunka fought for the First Ukrainian Division, also known as the Waffen-SS Galicia division or the SS 14th Waffen Division. This volunteer unit was commanded by the Nazis. Hunka himself confirmed it in a 2011 memoir . The Nazi Party ruled Germany from 1933 to the end of the war in 1945. It was also responsible for the Holocaust : the systematic murder of 6 million Jewish people and millions more Romani people , gay people, disabled people and others. After the war, about 600 members of the First Ukrainian Division were invited to live in Canada . Hunka was among them. Scandal in Canadian parliament On 22 September 2023 Zelenskyy addressed the Canadian parliament. Anthony Rota, the speaker of the house, had invited Hunka to sit in the gallery. After the Ukrainian president's speech, Rota called attention to Hunka, describing him as \"a Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero\". The 98-year-old was given two standing ovations by everyone in the chamber, including Zelenskyy . This was quickly condemned by several Jewish groups , and by Russia . Rota later apologised , saying none of his fellow parliamentarians or the Ukrainian delegation were aware of his plan to praise Hunka, or of the man's history. The photo of Zelensky on the envelope, and the portrait of Hunka on the stamp, are from the 22 September incident in Canada's parliament. The claim can also be seen on Facebook here , here and here , and on X, the social media platform formerly called Twitter, here , here and here . But has Ukraine really issued a stamp with Hunka's face on it? 'Free. Unbreakable. Invincible' stamp issued in 2022 Russia has continued to justify its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the ongoing war , as an attempt to \"denazify\" its neighbour. But there is no evidence that Ukraine is a Nazi country or has a Nazi government. A barcode on the right of the image , on the supposed envelope, reveals that the postage set with Hunka's portrait is fake. The barcode number is 4823027150765. We googled \"barcode lookup 4823027150765\". This did lead us to a Ukrainian postage stamp set , but not one honouring Hunka. Instead, the set is named \" Free. Unbreakable. Invincible \". It was issued on 24 August and is available for sale on several ecommerce sites . The set can also be seen on Ukrposhta , Ukraine's postal service website. Here it's described as commemorating six months since the Russian invasion and honouring \"Ukrainians who have become real heroes for the whole world\". A search for \"HEROES DON'T DIE\" \u2013 the wording on the viral image \u2013 on the Ukrposhta website returned no results. There is no evidence that Ukraine \"is now issuing stamps with the face of the WW2 Wafen SS Nazi Galicia cretin Yaroslav Hunko\".",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Fake newspaper covers are increasingly circulating on Kenyan social media platforms. One example is a cover linking prominent politician Harun Mwau to Ann Njeri Njoroge, who was at the centre of a KSh17 billion (about US$110 million) oil scandal. An image of what appears to be the front page of the Kenyan newspaper the Star has been shared online in Kenya, with the headline \"The Face Behind Ann Njeri Njoroge\". The page has a picture of businessperson Ann Njeri Njoroge and local politician Harun Mwau . The strap line adds: \"Shocking details reveals Kenyan billionaire Harun Mwau, behind 17bn fuel.\" The date of the page is 22 November 2023. Njoroge, a self-proclaimed oil importer, was linked to a KSh17 billion (about US$110 million) oil scandal in November 2023. She was summoned to appear before parliament to prove that she was the owner of a large fuel consignment. However, she failed to appear due to a sudden onset of illness. No stranger to controversy , Mwau briefly served as the first director of the country's Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The cover page has also been shared here and here . But is this a legitimate Star newspaper cover? We checked. 'Stay alert and beware of fake news' We checked the Star's archive of front pages and found that the 22 November issue did not match the front page in circulation . \"Revealed: Top county hospitals in big mess,\" reads the authentic front page of the Star newspaper on 22 November. The Star newspaper also posted on its social media pages that the cover in circulation was fake. \" Stay alert and beware of fake news. If it is not on our official pages, it is FAKE! Get the real copy by visiting http://mgazeti.com ,\" reads their post on X, formerly Twitter.",

        "doc": "Roets is correct that South African schools are often under-resourced, with few having either libraries or science labs, and that a sobering 80% could be considered \"dysfunctional\". However, he misleads about the requirements to pass matric and is wrong about the number of South Africans over 20 who have completed school. Roets understates the percentage of South Africans with university degrees. While the data is very concerning, his claims about how South African schoolchildren rank internationally and the share of the national budget used on education are misleading or incorrect. South Africa doesn't spend enough time discussing the \"disastrous state of its education system\", according to AfriForum's head of policy and action Ernst Roets . AfriForum describes itself as a non-governmental organisation that \"specifically focuses on the rights of Afrikaners\". In an eight-minute-long video , described as a \"fact sheet\", Roets makes a number of claims about South Africa's education system. The video was uploaded to Roets's personal YouTube channel on 3 June 2021, where it had been viewed just over 4,600 times at time of writing. Africa Check contacted Roets about the source of his information. At the time of publishing we had not received a response. This report interrogates nine of his claims. This claim has previously been refuted by government, education researchers and the National Professional Teachers' Organisation of South Africa . The national senior certificate (NSC), commonly referred to as matric, is the school leaving certificate completed at the end of secondary school in South Africa. Pupils are required to take a minimum of seven subjects. Four are compulsory : one first language, one first additional language, mathematics or mathematical literacy and life orientation. According to the department of basic education , the minimum requirements for a candidate to obtain the NSC are: Achieve 40% in three subjects, one of which must be your first language. Achieve 30% in three subjects. \"I can categorically say there is no such thing as a 30% pass mark for our national senior certificate,\" basic education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga told Africa. He said only a small number of pupils passed at the lowest requirements. According to the department's 2020 report , 61 pupils passed at the lowest criteria, representing 0.01% of all pupils. Most students passed at the highest achievement level, amounting to 210,820 students or 34.6%. This level, called a bachelor pass, requires pupils to obtain a minimum of 30% in the language of teaching and learning and a minimum of 50% in four recognised subjects. In the video , Roets goes on to say that South Africa performed \"worse than Zimbabwe, worse than North Korea, worse than Venezuela, worse than even the most desolate third world countries\". South Africa participates in three international assessments for basic education. This stage of schooling covers grade R to grade 12 , also known as matric. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) This is an international assessment of the mathematics and science knowledge of grade 4 and grade 8 pupils. The most recent assessment from 2019 included 58 countries. South Africa and Morocco were the only African countries included. North Korea, Zimbabwe and Venezuela were not assessed. South Africa was third last for average mathematics achievement of grade 4 pupils, with a score of 374 . It placed above Pakistan which had a score of 328 and the Philippines which had a score of 297 . The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) This assessment measures pupils' reading skills at a grade 4 level. The most recent assessment from 2016 included 50 countries . South Africa, Egypt and Morocco were the only African countries included. North Korea, Zimbabwe and Venezuela were not assessed. South Africa placed at the bottom with an average score of 320 . Russia placed at the top with a score of 581 . The Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) This study includes 15 ministries of education across southern and eastern Africa: Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The SACMEQ III project , which took place from 2006 to 2011, focused on examining knowledge of reading, maths, HIV and Aids among students and teachers. ( Note: More recent data from the SACMEQ IV project from 2012 to 2014 is available, but only for four countries. SACMEQ III has the most comprehensive data for all 15 countries.) Africa Check previously found that South Africa's average student reading score ranked it 10th out of 15 countries while its average maths score placed it eighth. In both reading and mathematics South Africa ranked below Zimbabwe but above Mozambique, Uganda, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi and Zambia. Calling South Africa 'worst in world' misleading, say experts Martin Gustafsson , a researcher with the department of economics at Stellenbosch University , told Africa Check: \"It is a common mistake to say South Africa is bottom of the world because its TIMSS or PIRLS scores tend to be the worst among all countries taking those tests. However, only around a quarter of all countries [in the world] take those tests.\" Nic Spaull is an associate professor in economics at Stellenbosch University . He told Africa Check that calling South Africa \"the worst in the world\" was not correct. Spaull said it was necessary to consider what percentage of children were enrolled in different countries. \"South Africa has almost full enrollment at primary school whereas if you compare us to Mozambique, for example, in 2007 only 50% of kids were in school,\" he explained. \"And they're the wealthiest 50% of kids. So you can't compare the 96% of South African kids in school with only 50% in other countries.\" National statistical agency Statistics South Africa's general household survey includes data on educational attainment. The survey found that 46.7% of adults aged 20 years and older had attained at least grade 12 in 2019. Of this figure, 30.8% of adults had attained grade 12 as their highest qualification, 15.4% had some post-school education, and 0.5% had other further education. Gustafsson previously provided Africa Check with a graph that uses data from the 2014, 2015 and 2016 general household surveys. He found that the number of students who had attained matric increased to just over 52% by the age of 24. The department of basic education publishes an annual National Education Infrastructure Management System (NEIMS) report which looks at infrastructure in public schools across the country. According to its 2020 report about one in four (25.4%) in South Africa have a library. The situation is worse than what Roets claimed. The best performing provinces were Gauteng where 63.9% of schools had libraries and the Western Cape where 62.5% of schools had libraries. The worst performing provinces were Limpopo where 7.1% of schools had a library and the Eastern Cape with 7.8% school where this was the case. According to the department's report , only 19.8% of schools in South Africa have a science laboratory. This is equal to about one in five. The highest performing provinces were the Western Cape where 33.9% of schools had a science laboratory and Gauteng where 33.4% of schools had a laboratory. The worst performing provinces were Limpopo where 6% of schools had a laboratory and the Eastern Cape where 6.9% of schools had a laboratory. PIRLS 2016 found that 78% of grade 4 pupils in South Africa failed to meet its lowest international reading benchmark. This led some outlets, like Eyewitness News, to report that \"78% of grade 4 pupils in SA are illiterate\". But Gustafsson told Africa Check that the PIRLS benchmark was not a benchmark for literacy. Rather it was a level the international PIRLS authorities believe \"one can reasonably expect a learner to reach by grade 4.\" Gustafsson said that a more detailed analysis of the PIRLS survey showed that 7% of pupils \"could not answer a single constructed response question in the PIRLS test\". This question is not a multiple-choice question and requires some writing by the pupil. \"Arguably, one could then say that 7% of learners cannot read and write,\" he said. However, Spaull says that the claim \"isn't incorrect\" but he would use the phrase \"78% of grade 4 students can't read for meaning\". Africa Check has previously investigated the same claim made by Roets in 2015. At the time we found that the claim was supported by available data. An analysis by Spaull showed that pupils in South Africa's wealthiest 25% of schools outperformed those in the remaining 75% of schools. Spaull told us that \"dysfunctionality\" was not a technical term. But a school might be considered \"dysfunctional\" if most of its pupils failed to demonstrate a level of ability appropriate to their age. Spaull suggested that as many as 90% of South African schools could be considered dysfunctional. Spaull's research from 2019 found that 71% of grade 4 pupils in the richest 10% of schools reached the PIRLS low international benchmark. In the other 90% of schools, far less than half of children reached this benchmark. Dr Stephanie Allais is the research chair of skills development and professor of education at the Centre for Researching Education and Labour at Wits University in Johannesburg. She told Africa Check that bachelor's, honour's, master's and doctoral degrees are the qualifications typically counted as \"degrees\". According to the 2019 general household survey, 4% of black South Africans 20 years and older had a degree. The percentages are much higher for Indian and white people, at roughly 16% and 24.7% respectively. Each of these percentages is higher than those given by Roets. Percentage of racial group with a degree Race group Roets' claim Official data (2019) Black African 3.1% 4% Indian 13.9% 16% White 18.3% 24.7% South Africa's 2021 national budget sets aside R402.9 billion of its total expenditure for \"learning and culture\". This is equivalent to roughly 19.9%. This amount includes R37.3 billion for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and R19.6 billion for \"education administration\". The vast majority of this spending is dedicated to basic education, which is assigned R255.1 billion. This represents about 12.6% of the total budget. The World Bank ranks countries according to spending on education as a percentage of total government spending. In 2019 South Africa ranked fifth at 19.5%. However, the World Bank only had data available for 16 countries in that year. The previous year, South Africa was ranked 20th in a (still incomplete) list of 63 countries. In 2017, when data was recorded for 115 countries, South Africa ranked 22nd. That year Costa Rica spent nearly a third of its total government spending on education. South Africa spent 18.7%.",

        "doc": "The coalition was correct that the youth, aged between 18 and 35, make up a whopping 75% of Kenya's unemployed, and also right about the size of foreign remittances in the Kenyan economy, which make up more than 3% of GDP. It also had its numbers mostly correct about the shrinking of the country's manufacturing sector, but was somewhat misleading on the impact of the \"blue economy\" on money matters. The coalition vastly overstated how many Kenyans in urban areas live in slums \u2013 the true numbers are just over a million, or 6.9 % of the urban population, not approximately 6.4 million people. In June 2022 , Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga published his pre-election pledges. The former prime minister is running on an Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition ticket, the fifth time he has stood for election. In his manifesto , Odinga made a number of promises, including that he would strengthen devolution, revive manufacturing and make monthly cash transfers to vulnerable households. He also promised a \"double-digit\" economic growth rate, free education, to end corruption, boost agriculture and tackle the high cost of living. We did not assess the viability of his campaign promises as we cannot fact-check the future. But we did sift through the evidence to find out if the manifesto cited the most accurate data on some key claims. The manifesto described the blue economy as the sustainable use of ocean and other water resources for, among other things, economic growth, food production and to improve livelihoods. It said Kenya's Vision 2030 , the national development roadmap, had identified the blue economy as a \"priority sector\". It then attributed the two million figure to the World Bank . A World Bank spokesperson sent us a link to a February 2022 brief about its blue economy initiative. This, however, did not include the figure. We found the exact words used in Odinga's manifesto in an August 2020 blog from the bank. Using this as a guide, we then worked our way through the bank's publications and established the estimate was first taken from a 2018 policy brief by the United Nations Development Programme . \"Fisheries \u2026 generate employment for over two million Kenyans through fishing, boat building, equipment repair, fish processing, and other ancillary activities\", the brief said . It did not cite the source of that statistic, however. The figure is not a World Bank finding. And its usage is in terms of fishing only, which is only one aspect of the blue economy. We therefore rate the claim misleading. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi This reduction had negatively affected industrialisation, the manifesto said. It added that manufacturing was \"ripe\" for fresh impetus after nearly a decade of regression. GDP refers to the gross domestic product, which is a measure of a country's economy. It is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country within a specific time, usually a year. In 2013, when outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta took office, Kenya's GDP was KSh4.7 trillion ($54.6 billion at 2013 exchange rates ). Manufacturing contributed KSh507.5 billion to this, or 10.8% . Kenya's national statistics office publishes its flagship economic survey annually. The most recent survey, from 2021, provisionally valued the Kenyan economy at KSh12.1 trillion. Manufacturing contributed KSh876.4 billion to this \u2013 or 7.2% of GDP. Figures for 2020 estimated the share of manufacturing at 7.6% of the GDP. The claim is mostly correct. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Kenya's 2019 census , which is the most recent, found the total population to be 47.56 million. The constitution defines a child as \"an individual who has not attained the age of 18\" while the youth are those between 18 and 35. The census data did show the population under 35 years as 35,700,787, or 75.1% of the total population. But of these people, 21.9 million, or 61%, were children under 18. Referring to this demographic as \"youth\" so as to score political points is misleading. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu The constitution defines the youth as those aged 18 and older, but below 35 years. The 2019 census data shows these were 13,777,600 or 29% of the total population, in this instance supporting the manifesto's claim. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu The country's statistics office collects unemployment data. Its most recent labour force report , published in May 2021, covers the first three months of that year. It showed a total working-age population \u2013 defined as those aged 15 to 64 \u2013 of 28 million people . Out of a total of 1,264,333 unemployed people , 959,889 were aged between 15 and below 35, considered youth for the purposes of labour statistics, and as per the Africa Youth Charter of the African Union . This works out to 75.9%. We therefore rate this claim correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenya's central bank defines remittances as \"money sent by a person in a foreign land to his or her home country\". The manifesto pledged to entice Kenyans living abroad to invest in the country. It then gave the annual remittances in 2021 as $3.7 billion. As evidence for this, it cited the diaspora remittances survey published in December 2021 by the central bank. The bank keeps a monthly record of remittances, denominated in the US dollar. The most recent data shows remittances for 2021 were valued at $3.72 billion. Kenya diaspora remittances 2021 Total (US$ million) January 278.3 February 260.3 March 290.8 April 299.3 May 315.8 June 305.9 July 336.7 August 312.9 September 309.8 October 337.4 November 320.1 December 350.6 Total 3,717.9 The claim is therefore correct. \u2013  Dancan Bwire In 2021, the year for which data is most recent, the country's statistics office estimated the GDP to be KSh12.1 trillion. Remittances totalled KSh413 billion that year. Using these provisional figures, remittances were equal to 3.4% of the GDP. We therefore rate the claim correct. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Kenya's statistics office defines informal settlements as \"urban settlements characterised by poor structural quality of housing; lack of formal basic services and infrastructure; and lack of surety of tenure. In most cases they are located in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas\". The World Bank's definition can be read here . The development lender's most recent data is from 2018, and it showed that 46.5% of Kenya's urban population lived in informal settlements. Contacted for the source of their data, a bank spokesperson directed us to Kenya's national statistics office. In turn, the data agency said the most recent report on urbanisation was published in April 2022, using 2019 census data. The report shows that 1,016,913 people live in informal settlements in urban areas. This is 6.9% of the total urban population of 14.8 million people. If 56% of the urban population lived in these settlements, the figure would be 8.2 million, not 6.4 million as claimed in the manifesto. \u2013 Tess Wandia",

Do white families earn six times more than black families? And do white people occupy 60% of top management positions in South Africa? These claims were made by former Economic Freedom Fight member of parliament, Andile Mngxitama, in a recent opinion piece written on behalf of the Black First Land First movement . Mngxitama has previously said that the movement aims \"to decolonialise and deracialise\" land ownership in South Africa, but spokesman, Lindsay Maasdorp, declined to comment on their objectives. 'Pseudo research outfits for colonialism' A vineyard of table grapes in De Doorns, a small farming town about 140 km North of Cape Town in January 2013. Photo: AFP/Rodger Bosch\" /> When Mngxitama wrote last year that \"about 40,000 white families own up to 80% of our land\", Africa Check found the statement was incorrect and not supported by any survey or data. Mngxitama seems to have taken the figures from two separate datasets: a state land audit (carried out by the office of South Africa's chief surveyor-general and published in 2013) and the 2007 census of commercial agriculture . The state land audit found that 79% of South Africa's landmass was in private hands, but it included all urban real estate as well as agricultural and mining land in South Africa, owned by both black and white South Africans, foreigners, companies and trusts. The commercial agriculture census only recorded farming units registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), which would have excluded smaller and recreational farmers. Of the 39,966 farming units identified, 33,249 were owned by individuals, with 2,167 belonging to companies, 2,259 to close corporations and 874 described as \"family-owned\". The census did not reflect the racial composition of the owners of farming units. It may be that this time round Mngxitama added the number of individually owned farming units to the family-owned ones, a figure that comes to 34,123. But when Africa Check emailed Mngxitama this week to request the sources for his claims, he did not respond. He replied to a tweet though, saying \"we don't respond to pseudo research outfits for colonialism. Go ahead and promote your racist ideology and interests.\" We then consulted the most recent economic and employment data to see whether it supported his claims. Unemployment Claim \"More than 45% of black people are unemployed compared with only 5% of white people.\" Verdict mostly-correct The latest employment statistics from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) for April to June 2015 revealed that 27.9% of black African people were unemployed in comparison to 7% of white people, according to the narrow definition of unemployment . Mngxitama's figures are closer to South Africa's broad unemployment rate , which includes discouraged job-seekers. These are people between 15 and 64 who want to work but are not actively searching for a job because they have lost hope, or want to work but are unable to find jobs in the area, or have been unable to find work that required their skills. The Stats SA data showed that in the second quarter of this year 39% of black African people were unemployed, according to the broad definition, compared to 8.3% of white people. Income Claim \"White families earn six times more than what black families earn. A black family's annual income is R60,000 whereas a white family earns an annual income of R360,000.\" Verdict mostly-correct Mngxitama's figures resemble estimates from South Africa's 2011 census , which found that the average annual income of black African households was R60,613 then. In comparison, white households' average annual income was six times higher at R365,134. However, service delivery statistics manager at Stats SA, Ni\u00ebl Roux, told Africa Check that the most recent and relevant data on household income was from their 2010/11 Income and Expenditure of Households Survey . Roux said the survey had been \"fine-tuned to measure household income and expenditure\". The survey, which gathered data between September 2010 and August 2011, estimated that black African households' average (or mean) income was R69,632. White households' average income was five and a half times higher at R387,011. A senior researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand's School of Economic and Business Sciences, Nicolas Pons-Vignon, told Africa Check that the median incomes of black African and white households provides further insight. The median income is the point where half the households earn more than it and half the households less. \"In a country as unequal as South Africa, high earners push the mean [average] above the median, for both populations though more for whites, unsurprisingly given that there are also many more poor black households,\" said Pons-Vignon. Black African households had a median income of R34,078 compared to their average of R69,632. This means that half of black African households have a household income of less than R34,078 per year. Household size Claim \"On average, a black family comprises six people compared with a white family of three people.\" Verdict incorrect Stats SA's Roux told Africa Check that, according to the 2011 census , the average black African household included 3.9 people. In comparison, an average white household was comprised of 2.8 people. The average coloured and Indian household were the largest, with 4.3 people and 4 people respectively. Management Claim \"Whites are only 10% of the economically active population but occupy more than 60% of the top management positions.\" Verdict mostly-correct The economically active population includes people aged from 15 to 64 who are either employed, or unemployed and seeking employment. This data comes from Stats SA's quarterly labour force surveys. Population Group Total Black African 76.2% Coloured 10.6% White 10.3% Indian 2.8% Source: Commission for Employment Equity 2014/15 Annual Report & Quarterly Labour Force Survey, Quarter 3, 2014 The commission for employment equity compiles an annual report on employment equity for the department of labour. The data in the report is submitted once a year by \"designated employers\", which include employers who employ 50 or more employees, employers who employ fewer than 50 employees but have a certain annual turnover, municipalities, all levels of government, state-owned companies and educational institutions. Submissions from designated employers for 2014/15 only accounted for 7 million employees out of the 20.3 million people in South Africa's economically active segment . Of these employees, 70% of top management level positions were held by white people, with 13.6% held by black African people. Coloured and Indian people held 4.7% and 8.4% of top management level positions respectively.

        "doc": "South African members of parliament are currently debating President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation address, which Africa Check fact-checked last week . We are fact-checking claims in the debate as they are made. Check back for updates. Mmusi Maimane, leader of the opposition Claim There are \"8.3 million jobless people\" in South Africa. Verdict correct Maimane's claim is correct according to the broad definition of unemployment . This includes people who are unemployed and looking for a job and discouraged job-seekers (people who are unemployed but not looking for work). South Africa's latest quarterly labour force survey revealed that there were 8,304,000 unemployed people (broadly defined) in South Africa in July to September of 2015. - Kate Wilkinson Factsheet: Unemployment statistics in South Africa explained Lindiwe Sisulu, minister of human settlements Claim \"In 1996 there were 3.4 million families residing in formal housing but by 2014 that number had increased to 9.4 million... An increase of 6 million houses that have been provided by this government.\" Verdict incorrect In 1996 there were 5,794,386 families living in formal dwellings in South Africa according to the presidency's development indicators - not 3.4 million as Sisulu claimed. People walk in the township of Demat, KwaZulu Natal. Photo: Rajesh Jantilal/AFP\" /> By 2014 an estimated 12,386,953 families were living in formal houses , an increase of just over 6.5 million. But not all of these houses were provided by government, as Sisulu claimed. The department of human settlements' own data shows that between 1996/97 and 2014/15 they had delivered 2,795,256 houses. - Kate Wilkinson Read: FACTSHEET: The housing situation in South Africa Read: Minister Sisulu is right \u2013 SA's housing delivery has almost halved since 2006/07 Claim \"In 1994 just over half of households had electricity, now 85% do.\" Verdict correct A national survey by the Southern Africa Labour Development Research Unit between 1993 and 1994 estimated that 53.6% of households had access to electricity . The latest data from Statistics South Africa shows that 86% of South African households had access to mains electricity in 2014 . Statistics for 2015 will be released later this year. - Kate Wilkinson READ: Zuma wrong on household electricity. About 50% of homes had access in 1994 Claim \"At the last analysis of the ratings of television programmes the parliamentary channel was rated as one of the most watched programmes.\" Verdict mostly-correct The African National Congress opened parliament to live television in 1994 to transform \"a stifled exclusive parliament into a people's parliament\", Sisulu said in her reply. But \"[w]hat went on in this chamber on Thursday last week was nothing but a disgraceful display of tantrums and theatrics,\" she said to describe opposition parties' delaying of the president's address. \"That is very good for television, but we're not competing with Idols here.\" Is the channel indeed one of South Africa's most watched? Africa Check asked South African television magazine tvplus for help with data. Parliamentary sittings are broadcast on channel 408 of satellite television service DStv . However, as it's not a revenue-based channel the parliamentary channel doesn't keep viewership statistics, writer Lav Nandlall established. When SABC2 and the SABC News channel broadcast parliamentary sittings they draw an average of 13,000 viewers on estimate, Nandlall was told. The broadcast of the State of a Nation Address is a different story. On 11 February 2016 nearly 2.5 million viewers tuned into SABC2 to watch the president and opposition parties battle it out for airtime. The SoNA attracted 23.7% of adults watching television at that time, as measured by the Broadcast Research Council of South Africa . Compared to the average viewership of South Africa's most popular soapies in January, parliament's version of \"tantrums and theatrics\" slots between 5th place Scandal (4,008,745 viewers on average) and 6th place Rhythm City (2,468,157). - Anim van Wyk Julius Malema, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Claim \"More than 26 million\" people in South Africa live in absolute poverty. Verdict correct \"Absolute poverty\" generally refers to a specific income threshold below which people would be unable meet their basic needs . Statistics South Africa has three absolute poverty lines which capture different degrees of poverty, lecturer at Stellenbosch University 's economics department, Marisa von Fintel, told Africa Check. \"The food poverty line captures their estimate of what is required in terms of food intake in order to survive, while the lower and upper bounds include the cost of other basic living requirements,\" Von Fintel explained. Malema's claim is correct when we look at the upper bound poverty line. The upper bound poverty line was R779 per person per month in 2011. Statistics South Africa estimated that 27,117,973 people (53.8% of the population) fell below this income threshold that year . At this level someone is considered to be living in poverty but able to buy the necessary food and non-food items they need. There were 18,632,646 people living under the lower bound poverty line, which in 2011 was R501 per person per month. Below this level someone does not have enough income to buy both enough food and non-food items. As a result they will have to go hungry to pay for things like clothing, shelter, transportation or education. In 2011, 10,944,089 people were living below the food poverty line, which equalled R335 per person per month. Someone under this line cannot afford enough food to meet their basic energy requirements of 2,100 calories per day. - Kate Wilkinson FACTSHEET: What is poverty? More claims of S. Africa's 'spectacular transformation' fact-checked Bheki Cele, deputy minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries Claim \"[The agricultural] sector is currently facing the worst drought ever recorded in the history of South Africa.\" Verdict unproven South Africa received the lowest average rainfall between January and December 2015 since 1904 - a total of 403 mm, according to the South African Weather Service . The lack of rainfall has caused agriculture to suffer. As Cele said, South Africa will now have to import maize in order to meet local demand. Chenin Blanc vines grow on a farm managed by the Kleine Zalze estate in Stellenbosch. Photo: AFP/Rodger Bosch\" /> However, receiving the lowest rainfall on record does not automatically mean the current drought is the worst South Africa has ever experienced. That is because lack of rainfall is only one of the factors that lead to a drought. Professor at the Wits Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute , Bob Scholes, told Africa Check that it is therefore still too early to measure the drought's severity or compare it to previous ones. Professor of agrometeorology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Michael Savage added that more research will need to be carried out to measure the extent of the drought. - Lebohang Mojapelo READ: Frequently asked questions about South Africa's drought Phumzile Van Damme, Democratic Alliance spokesman Claim \"The unemployment rate amongst our youth is more than twice that of adults.\" Verdict correct In South Africa the \"youth\" are people aged between 15 and 34 . Using Statistics South Africa's quarterly labour force survey data , Africa Check calculated that 35.8% of people aged 15 to 34 were unemployed between July and September 2015. In comparison, 16.6% of people aged 35 to 64 were unemployed. The broad unemployment rate - which includes unemployed people and discouraged job seekers - showed a similar trend. Youth unemployment was 46.1%, while 23.2% of people aged 35 to 64 were jobless. - Kate Wilkinson Derek Hanekom, minister of tourism Claim \"Recently the influential site Buzzfeed voted South Africa as the most beautiful country in the world.\" Verdict incorrect When a Buzzfeed listicle called \" The 20 most beautiful countries in the world \" was published last year it quickly went viral . Starting with Nepal, the article included countries such as India, Switzerland, Colombia and China, with New Zealand placed third, the United States runner-up and South Africa as number one. However, this post was not a product of Buzzfeed itself, but appeared on the Buzzfeed Community section where anyone can \"share humor, cool stuff you've found, insights into identity and fandom, personality and trivia quizzes, and the occasional ode to Taylor Swift\". Africa Check tried to contact the article's creator \" TravelGuru \" but Brett Vergara, associate community manager of BuzzFeed, said that they \"aren't allowed to give out the contact information of community users\". It's really cool for South Africa that a Buzzfeed user thought it's the most beautiful country in the world, but it's not really something to boast about in parliament, Minister Hanekom. - Anim van Wyk Naledi Pandor, minister of science and technology Claim \"Our government has also taken action to address the funding needs of the poorest as shown as having invested over R50 billion in loans and bursaries via the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS).\" Verdict unproven South Africa's National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) provides financial aid for students in higher education who are \"from poor and working class families who would otherwise not be able to afford to study\". The scheme has been providing study loans and bursaries since 1991, and up to the end of March 2015, had disbursed R49.82 billion worth of financial assistance to students, according to its 2014/15 annual report . This was in aid of 1.5 million students. NSFAS spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo told Africa Check that for the 2015/2016 year they \"had a budget of R9.5 billion which was estimated to fund just over 420,000 students\". However, this is an unaudited figure, he said. Sorry Minister Pandor, but we'll therefore have to rate this claim \"unproven\" until it's confirmed that \"over R50 billion\" has been disbursed. - Lebohang Mojapelo",

        "doc": "In a TV interview, billionaire businessman Jimi Wanjigi quoted statistics that cast the economic management of current president Uhuru Kenyatta in a poor light. Wanjigi was right to say that debt repayments took 18% of revenue when former president Mwai Kibaki left office, and that GDP growth in 2007 was 7%. He was also correct that Kenyatta won the 2013 election by just 800,000 or so votes. But his claims about current debt repayments and growth under the Daniel arap Moi administration were exaggerated. Claims about the poverty rate were incorrect, and a claim about agriculture misleading. With less than a year to Kenya's elections, controversial businessman Jimmy Wanjigi discussed his presidential ambitions at length for the first time, on national TV . In the 29 August 2021 interview on Citizen TV , Wanjigi answered questions about his businesses, political history , subsequent fallout with the current government, and more. Kenya's general elections are set for 9 August 2022 . To make his case, Wanjigi cited statistics as evidence of the government's economic mismanagement.  We checked seven of his claims. We asked Wanjigi's office for the source of his figures. Spokesperson Isaac Njuguna said the claims were accurate and the data from the official Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . He also sent us the bureau's 2020 poverty report . In the interview, Wanjigi said debt repayments had drastically increased and were choking the country's business environment. He said the sharp increase had been in the last nine years of president Uhuru Kenyatta's government, a trend not seen under his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki . \"When Kibaki left power, of every KSh100 of Kenyan revenue collections, KSh18 went to [repaying] debt,\" Wanjigi said . Kibaki left office on 9 April 2013. Kenya's total public debt was then KSh1.8 trillion, according to data from the Central Bank of Kenya and the national treasury . The most recent data shows that by June 2021, this debt had grown to KSh7.7 trillion. To verify the level of debt at the end of Kibaki's term, John Kinuthia , a senior programmes officer at the Kenyan office of budget transparency think tank International Budget Partnership , advised us to check the treasury's annual debt management reports . The 2013 debt report says 18.7% of revenue went to repaying debt in the last financial year of Kibaki's term, ending in June 2013. \"Wanjigi's KSh18 figure out of every KSh100 for 2013 was not that far off,\" Kinuthia said. We therefore rate the claim as correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma We asked Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at Kenya's statistics bureau, where to look. He directed us to the treasury's public debt register . The most recent publicly available version is for the 2019/2020 financial year. This shows that at the end of the financial year, in June 2020, 41.4% of revenue was used to repay debt. The International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia said the data varied from year to year. For example, in June 2019 debt repayment took 58.8% of revenue. Even projections for debt payment in a financial year were different to what was actually spent, Kinuthia added. The Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that debt service for the 2020/21 financial year would be 66% of revenue, or KSh66 out of every KSh100. In 2020 the International Monetary Fund had a similar figure of 68% , but this year revised it to 47.6%. We have not seen any data that supports Wanjigi's claim that 75% of revenue currently goes to debt repayment, even if it is clear that since 2013, debt servicing has risen sharply. \u2014 Makinia Juma Mwai Kibaki took over from Kenya's second president, Daniel arap Moi, on 30 December 2002. For historical growth data, senior Kenya National Bureau of Statistics manager Benjamin Muchiri directed us to the bureau's annual economic surveys and to central bank data. The World Bank's data portal was also a good source, he said, as it is compiled from the national accounts of member countries. According to the bureau's economic surveys, Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.4% in 2002. The central bank had this at 0.5% , the same as the World Bank. GDP is a widely used measure of the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a specific period, usually a year. We found no evidence that Kenya had a negative growth rate in 2002. The data shows that while Moi's 24-year rule was marked by low growth , only 1992 saw economic contraction, at -7%. Wanjigi's claim is inflated, but the economy did grow consistently under Kibaki. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The economic survey data for 2010 shows growth in 2007 was at 7%. Kenya's central bank recorded 6.9%, as did the World Bank. The data shows consistent growth from 2002 to 2007. We therefore rate Wanjigi's claim as correct. In 2008 growth tanked to 0.2% following the global financial crisis and the effects of a disputed election , before rebounding to 8.4% in 2010. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Wanjigi's team attributed this claim to a 2020 report by the national data agency, which they shared with us. It was co-authored by UN Women and Unicef . But the agency does not compile annual poverty rate statistics, the International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia told Africa Check. Its most recent statistics were released in 2018 and have data for 2015/16. This data defines \"overall poverty\" as households and individuals whose monthly expenditure \"is less than KSh3,252 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh5,995 in core-urban areas\". It gives the national poverty headcount rate as 36.1%, a fall from the 2005/06 rate of 46.6%. When Kenyatta took office in 2013, the available data puts the poverty rate at 46.6%, 10 percentage points higher than the 36% Wanjigi claimed. Multidimensional index looks beyond income But is the current poverty rate 52%? We asked Paul Samoei, a senior manager for research and development at the Kenya statistics bureau who works on poverty data. He said t he index in the 2020 report was not a measure of the overall poverty rate. \"The multidimensional index looks beyond income to include access to safe water, education, electricity, food, and six other indicators,\" he said. A closer look at the 2020 report shows that it uses data from the 2015/16 survey. The statistics bureau also warns that the findings should be interpreted with caution, due to survey design limitations. Given these facts, we rate Wanjigi's claim as misleading. \u2013 Makinia Juma We asked Dr Timothy Njagi , a development economist and research fellow at the Tegemeo Institute , an agriculture policy think tank hosted at Egerton University , where we could find data to verify this claim. He directed us to the statistics bureau's economic survey. This shows that in 2020, animal production made up 3.6% of national GDP, not 4% of \"agricultural GDP\". Wanjigi seemed to have mangled his numbers, Njagi said. Does livestock employ around 100,000 people? There is no official data on the number of people employed in the agricultural sector because Kenya has never done an agricultural census, Njagi said. And most smallholder farmers practise mixed farming, engaged both in livestock and crop production. Double counting would therefore be a concern with any estimate, he said. \u2013 Dancan Bwire In 2013, Kenyatta narrowly beat Raila Odinga, an outcome the opposition leader unsuccessfully challenged in court . Wanjigi said he ran a tallying centre that confirmed Kenyatta's victory. He said : \"Kenyatta won that election. Didn't you see the difference in votes? The difference was 800,000 votes. I believe the competitors went to court and what happened? They lost.\" Chris Kerkering is litigation manager at the Katiba Institute , a nonprofit organisation that promotes knowledge of the constitution and its use in society. For a candidate to be declared winner of a presidential election in Kenya, they must have 50% plus one vote in their basket. \"The candidate also has to have 25% of the votes in each of more than half of the counties cast in their favour,\" said Kerkering. He pointed us to the electoral commission 's data for the 2013 elections, which shows that Kenyatta narrowly pipped Odinga by a slim margin, winning 50.07% of the vote. The data shows Kenyatta got 6,173,433 votes, and Odinga 5,340,546 \u2013 a difference of 832,887 votes. The claim is therefore correct. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi",

        "doc": "On 16 February 2019, Nigerians will head to the polls to choose a new president. One candidate is Obiageli Ezekwesili, who has twice served as a national minister and had a stint as the World Bank's Africa division head. Ezekwesili is also known for her role in the Bring Back Our Girls movement and as a co-founder of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International. She is running on the ticket of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria . In Project Rescue Nigeria , her election manifesto, Ezekwesili made a number of claims. We looked closer at eight of them. (Note: We have contacted her campaign for the evidence used for these claims, but they are yet to respond.) Claim \" Singapore... got its independence five years after Nigeria [and] now has a real GDP per capita of $57,722, while Nigeria's GDP per capita as at 2017 was $1,951.\" Verdict correct Ezekwisili drew a number of comparisons between Singapore and Nigeria in her manifesto. Singapore became independent in 1965, five years after Nigeria. Obiageli Ezkwesili is pictured in 2007 in Cape Town, South Africa. The former Nigerian minister is gunning for the Nigerian presidency. Photo: AFP/GIANLUIGI GUERCIA According to the World Bank 's most recent data on the gross domestic product of countries, in 2017 Nigeria's real GDP per capita was US$1,968 (having started off at $93 in 1960), while Singapore's was $57,714, from $516 in 1965. Ezekwesili's claim is therefore correct. Real or constant GDP removes the effect on inflation on the value of an economy's output. GDP per capita, or \"per person\", divides a country's total gross domestic product by the number of people living there . When the different cost of living in the two countries \u2013 or purchasing power parity \u2013 is considered, in 2017 Singapore's GDP per capita was $85,535 and Nigeria's $5,338. (Note: Nigeria's most recent official population estimate was 193.4 million in 2016, and Singapore's population was 5.64 million as at the end of June 2018.) Claim \"Today, adult literacy in Singapore is 98%, while adult literacy in Nigeria is just 57%.\" Verdict mostly-correct The adult literacy rate is the share of a population aged 15 years and older who can read and write , and understand short simple statements about everyday life, according to Unesco, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization . In 2017 the Unesco Institute for Statistics grouped Nigeria among countries with adult literacy rates of 50% to 59%, while Singapore was in the group with literacy rates of 90% to 100%. Unesco's most recent specific literacy rate for Nigeria is 51%, in 2008 . The Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics ' most recent survey of adult literacy , conducted in 2010, used the Unesco definition . It found adult literacy in the English language to be 57.9% and adult literacy in any language to be 71.6%. (Note: In 2010 Singapore's adult literacy rate was 96%.) But in this country-to-country comparison it is better to use Nigeria's English language literacy rate, Olasupo Jegede, a professor of adult education at the University of Lagos , told Africa Check. \"The adult literacy rate in any language is bound to be higher because it could be in any of the over 200 languages in Nigeria,\" Jegede said. Claim \"Unfortunately, more than 70% of Nigerians have pre-school children without access to Early Child Care Education.\" Verdict incorrect The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey , conducted from September 2016 to January 2017, gives the most recent and reliable data on access to early childhood education in Nigeria. This is according to Oriyomi Ogunwale, head of Eduplana , an organisation that monitors education standards in Nigeria. \"Access to early childhood education is the percentage of the population, children five years old and younger, who are attending school. Basic education starts from age six,\" he told Africa Check. The nationally representative survey of 28,578 children found that 35.6% of those aged 36 to 59 months attended an early childhood education programme. The survey also interviewed 28,085 mothers and caretakers of these under-five children. The share of pre-school children without access to early childhood education was estimated at 64.4%, not at more than 70%. Claim \"[The] mining sector contribution to GDP [is] below 1%...\" Verdict correct Ezekwesili was Nigeria's minister of solid minerals in 2005 and 2006. The official statistics agency often includes crude petroleum and natural gas extraction, coal and metal ore mining, quarrying and other activities in the overall \"mining and quarrying\" sector. Does this sector's output make up less than 1% of gross domestic product? In July to September 2018, mining and quarrying contributed 10.55% to GDP, according to quarterly data from the agency. Crude petroleum and natural gas accounted for nearly all (98%) of this contribution, but are not regulated by the ministry of mines and steel. Cyril Azobu of Pricewaterhouse Coopers in Nigeria told Africa Check that the country's mining sector essentially referred to the extraction of solid minerals, and didn't include the oil and gas industry. \"Nigeria's mining sector is not big because there are no majors [big companies],\" he said. \"It is made up mostly of artisanal and small-scale miners, hence its little contribution to GDP.\" The statistics agency's data shows solid mineral mining contributed 0.2% to GDP in the three months. Claim \"With the nation's entire federal budget peaking at around $30 billion...\" Verdict mostly-correct Ezekwesili said Nigeria's federal budget had topped out at \"around $30 billion\".  The government budget increased from N7.44 trillion ($24.4 billion) in 2017 to N9.12 trillion ($29.9 billion) in 2018 based on the official exchange rate of N305 to the US dollar. But this is not Nigeria's largest budget in US dollars. In 2014, the federal government budget of N4.965 trillion was $31.04 billion at the then official exchange rate of N160 to the dollar. Claim \"Less than 30% of the federal budget is allocated to capital expenditure.\" Verdict incorrect The candidate claimed that less than 30% of the federal budget goes to capital expenditure. But in the budgets of 2017 and 2018, the allocation to capital expenditure was more than 30%. It was 31.7% in 2017 and 31.5% in 2018. (Note: This is a claim made frequently in Nigeria. Read more on our work checking it here .) Claim \"From 1999 to date, all the projections made by successive governments to grow the supply of electricity to Nigerians to either 6,000MW, 10,000MW or 20,000MW have not been met.\" Verdict correct One of  President Muhammadu Buhari's promises during his campaign for the 2015 elections was to \"vigorously pursue the expansion of electricity generation and distribution of up to 40,000 megawatts in four to eight years\". In 2003 then-president Olusegun Obasanjo, during the inaugural speech for his second term, pledged to produce 10,000 MW. We have not yet found when the 6,000 MW and 20,000 MW projections were made. But the highest peak electricity transmission yet reached in Nigeria was 5,222.3MW, in December 2017. Official data - last updated in September 2018 - shows this historic peak has not been exceeded. Claim \"Nigeria currently has 187 policemen for every 100,000 Nigerians, the UN recommends a ratio of 300 police officers to 100,000 people.\" Verdict unproven There's no publicly available data on the number of police officers in Nigeria. Africa Check continues to seek this data from the Police Service Commission . The UN ratio is also troublesome, as public officials in Nigeria and other African countries often use different numbers. For example, in May 2017 former inspector-general of police Ibrahim Idris in said Nigeria needed to hire \" 155,000 [officers] to police a population of approximately 182 million\" so as to meet \"the UN ratio requirement of one police officer to 400 citizens\". Africa Check traced this \"ratio requirement\" back to 1945. But, the UN does not prescribe any policing ratio, as different countries have different needs.",

        "doc": "Osun state voters will in a few days elect a governor, picking from a slate of 15 candidates . The state is in southwest Nigeria and has a population of about 4.7 million . Ahead of the 16 July 2022 election, four candidates took part in a debate organised by broadcast channel Arise News , one of two such debates, the other being on Channels TV . They were governor Adegboyega Oyetola, who is seeking re-election on an All Progressives Congress ticket, Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party , Goke Omigbodun of the Social Democratic Party and Labour Party 's Lasun Yusuf. We looked at seven claims gleaned from the Arise News debate . Adegboyega Oyetola - APC In December 2021, Folorunsho Bamisayemi, the commissioner responsible for education in the state, announced the hiring of 1,000 new teachers for public schools. More teachers would be recruited later, Bamisayemi said in a statement. Training for the new teachers took place in January 2022 . Primary healthcare centres are the first port of call in Nigeria's health system. In March 2019, governor Oyetola announced the \"revitalisation\" of, among others, 332 primary healthcare centres. Nine months later, the state claimed his administration had \"fully completed\" 131 health centres. In July 2020, the governor's chief press secretary, Ismail Omipidan, said 226 healthcare centres had been \"rehabilitated and renovated\", as he pushed back at criticism from the opposition. But Africa Check was unable to independently verify this. In December 2021, an investigation by online newspaper HumAngle Media , cast significant doubt on the quality of the work, which it said was funded by a donor grant. In the absence of independent data, we rate this claim as unproven. The bill to establish the health insurance scheme was passed by the state assembly in October 2018. It was signed into law by Rauf Aregbesola, Oyetola's predecessor, also from the APC. However, its operations only started in April 2019, five months after Oyetola was sworn in . In March 2022, Adeoye Adelakun, the chair of the Osun Health Insurance Agency, told journalists that 206,659 residents have registered for the scheme. This is under 5% of the state's estimated population as of 2016. Tanimola Akande, a professor of public health at the University of Ilorin , in the country's Kwara state described this sign up rate as \"very poor\". \"The global target is that everyone should have access to health services when needed without suffering financial hardship, so that coverage level is far away from the target,\" he told Africa Check. Akande gave some factors for low coverage. \"Generally, Nigerians have a very poor attitude about insurance,\" he said. \"It is not necessarily the problem of affordability since Nigerians can afford to buy uniform outfits for parties known as asoebi [ a type of African dress ], they should be able to afford health insurance, that's my own view.\" \"Religion is also compounding the problem because people believe that they will not fall ill so why should they pay ahead for illness?\" Akin Ogunbiyi - Accord Party According to a 2017 brochure on Nigeria's mining sector by the ministry of mines and steel , nine minerals in possible commercial quantities can be found in Osun state. These minerals are clay, granite, talc, dolomite, feldspar, quartz, limestone, mica, and gold. According to data from the ministry of mines and steel , four mining leases and one small-scale mining lease are currently active in Osun state. Of the five leases , two are operated by private companies, two by the Nigerian Mining Corporation and the last by Omoluabi Mineral Promotion Company Limited , a company owned by the state. The state has entered other partnerships with Chinese firms, dating back to 2016 , including in mining. Goke Omigbodun - Social Democratic Party Out-of-school children refers to the number of children and young people in the official age range, for the given level of education, who are not enrolled in pre-primary, primary, secondary or higher levels of education. The 2016/17 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey published by Unicef , the UN agency that focuses on the well-being of children, has data on out-of-school children. The survey sampled more than 37,000 households nationally. Results show that in Osun, 26.9% of children within the primary school age bracket did not attend school . This dropped to 10.5% among children within the secondary school age bracket. Besides the economic status of parents, there are other factors to blame for the problem of out-of-school children, according to Stephen Olubadewo. He is a professor of educational administration at the Bayero University in Nigeria's Kano state, with a focus on the relationship between parents' economic status and the academic performance of students. \"Situations where facilities are inadequate or teachers are not well motivated also contribute to this problem,\" he said.  Both the government and the public had a role to play in changing this,Olubadewo added. Osun state's poverty rate was last measured at 8.52% in 2019 . This is according to the National Bureau of Statistics . The Nigeria Living Standard Survey was done to estimate living standards. It focused on household expenditures and poverty headcount ratios , sampling 22,110 households nationally over 12 months. The survey identified the poor as those living below the poverty line of N137,430 a year or N376.5 a day. At the time, this translated to $353 per year or 97 US cents a day. This has dropped to $313 per year or 90 US cents a day, based on the June 2022 official exchange rate , because of the devaluation of the naira. In the survey, Osun state had the third-lowest poverty rate in the country.",

He said that today, tax revenues are over KSh1.3 trillion and Kenya spends 43% of its national budget on development. The claim about current tax income is correct. The claims about earlier taxes and development spend are incorrect. The leader of the majority party in Kenya's national assembly wasted no time in trading punches with his TV host as he waded into a national controversy over increased taxes. Aden Duale called his house colleagues \"hypocrites\" for their handling of the imposition of a 16% value added tax on petroleum products. He then went on to make a number of claims about the country's finances. In the September 2018 interview with Citizen TV host Hussein Mohammed, the majority leader defended the government's increased borrowing, saying this was necessary to build infrastructure. We weighed up three of the claims. Asked for his evidence, Duale directed Africa Check to both the national treasury and the Parliamentary Budget Office , which advises lawmakers on public finances and the economy. Claim \"In 2002, when the National Rainbow Coalition took over power, Kenya Revenue Authority was collecting close to about KSh600 billion.\" Verdict incorrect In the interview, Duale said the context for this statement was that a growth in tax revenues in recent years had created space for more borrowing. Opposition group the National Rainbow Coalition (Narc) won Kenya's December 2002 general election, leading to Mwai Kibaki becoming president. During that financial year, which runs from 1 July to 30 June, data from the Kenya Revenue Authority shows it collected KSh201.6 billion, not the KSh600 billion Duale mentioned. Revenue collection first breached KSh600 billion in the 2010/11 financial year, when the tax agency collected KSh635 billion . Claim \"Today the Kenya Revenue Authority is collecting over KSh1.3 trillion.\" Verdict correct In 2016/17, the last full financial year for which data is available, the tax agency collected KSh1.365 trillion. Source: KRA's 6th Corporate Plan Claim \"Kenya spends 43% of its national budget on development.\" Verdict incorrect Challenging interview host's Hussein Mohammed 's claim that the government was spending only 30% of its revenue on development, Duale said the correct figure was 43%. The law that governs public spending in Kenya states that a minimum of 30% of both national and county budgets go to development spending. Kenya's treasury put KSh625.1 billion aside for development in the 2018/19 budget speech . This is 24.5% of the KSh2.556 trillion budget. The figure accounts for spending by the national government and counties, and other charges such as debt and interest repayments. In the act that authorised the national budget, KSh410 billion of the KSh1.35 trillion in expenditure was marked as development spend. This was for central government and independent commissions and works out to 30.3%, similar to Mohammed's figure. Over the last five financial years, only in 2013/14 has the government met the 30% development target, according to parliament's budget office. The five-year average development spend has been 28.4%.

        "doc": "One claim, about diaspora remittances, is correct. One about cellphone penetration is mostly correct. Kenyatta even understated achievements in funds sent to counties, and access to clean water. Two misleading claims are about the value of remittances and exports, and the \"tripling\" of GDP. A claim about internet penetration is unproven. Four claims are incorrect: about the rise in remittances, the primary to secondary school transition rate, power generation, and health insurance coverage. And two more \u2013 about the Kenyan economy's ranking in Africa, and tax revenue \u2013 are exaggerated. Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta gave his final address on a national holiday as the country marked 59 years of self-rule after colonialism on 1 June 2022. For the first time, Madaraka Day was observed at Nairobi's Uhuru Gardens, historic for the lowering of the Union Jack and the hoisting of the first Kenyan flag in 1963. Kenyatta used the event to highlight his record since being first elected in 2013. His second and final term ends with Kenya's next elections, set for 9 August. In his speech, he made claims about county funding, diaspora remittances, internet and cellular penetration, education, the economy and revenue collection, and more. In this report we examine 13 of his claims. We contacted Kanze Dena-Mararo , the president's spokesperson, and Andrew Wakahiu , who heads the president's delivery unit , for the data used in the claims. We will update this report with their responses. ( Note: We will tackle separate claims about agriculture and roads in upcoming reports. ) Kenya's 2013 election also birthed its 47 counties . Their development has therefore been only under Kenyatta. These units of government had \"forever changed the face of Kenya\", Kenyatta said in his speech, \"buoyed by the KSh2.44 trillion transferred by the national government to the counties\". The counties are funded monthly by the national treasury , a process that involves the office of the controller of budget . Treasury data shows counties received KSh2.44 trillion (about US$20.9 billion at current exchange rates) from March 2013 to 30 June 2021, when the last financial year ended. This appears to back Kenyatta's claim. But the controller of budget has more recent data, which shows that as of December 2021 , KSh2.5 trillion, or close to KSh60 billion more, had been transferred to the counties. Transfers from the national government to Kenyan counties, 2012 to 2022 Financial year Amount (KSh billion) 2012/13 9.7 2013/14 174.4 2014/15 228.5 2015/16 272.1 2016/17 299.7 2017/18 328.9 2018/19 327.8 2019/20 332.7 2020/21 379.9 2021/22 * 144.98 Total 2,498.68 *Half-year report until December 2021 Source: Controller Of Budget reports Further, the president said \"to date\". Newer treasury data shows that KSh261 billion had been sent to the counties by 28 April 2022, taking the total since 2013 to KSh2.7 trillion, or at least KSh250 billion more. This data was published on 13 May and would have been available to his office. We therefore rate the claim as understated. The president missed the chance to claim a higher increase. ( Note: For what these ratings mean, read here .) \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's central bank defines remittances as \"money sent by a person in a foreign land to his or her home country\". The bank keeps a monthly record of these funds, in US dollars. The most recent data is from April 2022. The \"last decade\" for which there's publicly available data is therefore from April 2012 to April 2022. In April 2012, remittances were recorded as $95.6 million . In April 2022, they were at $355 million \u2013 a near four-fold increase, and not the \"10 times\" claimed by Kenyatta . When calendar years are considered, remittances were $891 million in 2011, rising to $3.72 billion in 2021. This is also a four-fold increase. If currency movements are accounted for, the increase between 2011 and 2021 is about five times. One US dollar exchanged at an average of KSh88.81 in 2011, when KSh79.1 billion was sent, and at KSh109.65 in 2021 , when remittances totalled KSh407.9 billion. None of these scenarios show a tenfold rise. We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Dancan Bwire But the president's claim that remittances were at their highest level in 2021 is correct, according to publicly available data. Central bank remittance data goes as far back as 2004. It shows that the highest total was in 2021, when KSh408 billion ($3.72 billion at current rates) was sent home. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Kenya's leadership on regional and international stages had created opportunities for Kenyans, Kenyatta said . Kenya had been key to the Democratic Republic of the Congo joining the East African Community , and the country began a two-year term as a member of the UN Security Council in January 2021 . This \"in return\" had led to the growth in remittances, with their value surpassing that of the country's top traditional exports. But this first happened in 2013 \u2013 the president's first year in office and nine years ago. In 2011, Kenya's top exports were tea, valued at KSh102 billion, and horticulture, worth KSh83 billion. That year, remittances were KSh79.1 billion . This pattern was repeated in 2012. Value of key exports from 2011 to 2015 (KSh bn) Year Horticulture Tea Remittances 2011 83.3 102.2 79.1 2012 81.1 101.4 99 2013 89.3 104.6 111.1 2014 97.1 94 125.6 2015 101 123 152 Source: Economic survey 2015 and 2018 , and the Kenyan central bank \u2013 Dancan Bwire Unesco, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization , defines the transition rate to secondary school as the share of pupils in the final grade of primary school who enrol in the first grade of secondary school the following school year. Kenyatta said his government had raised the transition rate to 100%, but did not give the year this happened. In their final year of primary school, pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education for a chance to join secondary school. Kenya's national statistics bureau publishes transition rates in its annual economic surveys. The most recent survey gives the rate as 78.5% in 2021. It was 91% in 2020, 85.5% in 2019 and 83.1% in 2018. The president made the same claim in his 2019 and 2020 state of the nation addresses. In both instances we found it to be incorrect. The most recent publicly available data shows the transition rate has never reached 100%. Experts have previously told Africa Check that, without a law making secondary school compulsory, achieving the full rate was difficult. Secondary school is also not completely free, keeping some students away. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenyatta attributed this rise to his government's \"massive investment\" in information and communication technology (ICT). Internet penetration refers to the share of the population that uses the internet. Martin Schaaper is a senior analyst at the International Telecommunication Union , the UN agency that focuses on ICT. He directed Africa Check to an ITU dashboard that has the most recent data on penetration. \"We estimate that the internet penetration in Kenya stood at 13% in 2013, rising to 29.5% in 2020,\" Schaaper told Africa Check. He also cited Kenya's 2019 census which showed that only 22.6% of Kenyans had access to the internet. \"We know that in Kenya, the regulator has a formula to estimate internet use based on the number of subscriptions to fixed and mobile broadband subscriptions,\" he said. \"But we believe that that formula is strongly overstating the real number of internet users.\" The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) is responsible for regulating ICT. Other official data is also inconsistent. For instance, the statistics bureau, using CA data, says there were 13.1 million users in Kenya in 2013, but the 2019 census estimate is lower, at 9.9 million . World Bank data shows that internet penetration in Kenya rose from 13% in 2013 to 29.5% in 2020. We asked the communications authority how it calculates the rate. Director-general Ezra Chiloba directed us to one of his officers for details. We will update this report when we hear back. Until then we rate the claim as unproven . \u2013 Dancan Bwire Martin Schaaper, the ITU analyst, told Africa Check the available data indicated that there were 70 mobile phone subscriptions for every 100 people in 2013. For 2020, the ITU's digital development dashboard puts the number at 114 subscriptions per 100 people. In 2021, Schaaper said, there were 118 subscriptions per 100 people. The agency did not have 2022 data yet, he said. It will only be available next year. The most recent publicly available data from the national statistics office puts the mobile phone penetration rate at 131.88 subscriptions per 100 people, an increase from 74.9 per 100 people \u2013 or 74.9% \u2013 in 2013. As the ITU gets its data from Kenya's communications authority , we rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Dancan Bwire John Kinuthia , a senior programmes officer at the International Budget Partnership 's Kenya office, said we should look at GDP data from the Kenya national bureau of statistics to evaluate this claim . The partnership is a think tank focused on budget transparency. For comparative data, he directed us to check with international institutions such as the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank . Gross domestic product (GDP) is a widely used measure of the size of a country's economy. It is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. World Bank data puts the value of Kenya's economy at $61.7 billion in 2013, ranking it ninth on the continent. The most recent GDP data, for 2020, values it at $101 billion and places Kenya seventh \u2013 not sixth. Rank Country 2020 GDP (current US$ bn) 1 Nigeria 432.29 2 Egypt 365.25 3 South Africa 335.44 4 Algeria 145.01 5 Morocco 114.73 6 Ethiopia 107.65 7 Kenya 101.01 8 Ghana 68.53 9 Tanzania 62.41 Source: World Bank We rate this claim as exaggerated. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Kenyatta has made the claim about tripling the economy before , as has his finance minister Ukur Yatani. We found both claims to be wrong. Official data valued Kenya's economy at KSh4.7 trillion in 2013. The World Bank had a slightly higher figure of KSh5.31 trillion. The most recent economic survey data estimates the country's GDP at KSh12.1 trillion in 2021. The treasury and finance minister expect GDP to be KSh12.6 trillion in 2022. But experts have previously told us that this claim leaves out important context. This is that the Kenyan economy was rebased in 2014 and 2021 , and that there have been significant price changes since 2013.  Public debt has also risen sharply under the Kenyatta administration. Higher GDP doesn't mean everyone is better off The gist of Kenyatta's much repeated claim is that everyone is significantly better off. But Margarida Domingues de Carvalho, who works with Eurostat , the European Union 's statistical office, has previously told Africa Check there were problems with using GDP to show gains. \"GDP is often misinterpreted as a measure of societal progress and well-being, which it is not,\" she said in an email. \"GDP and GDP growth only give indications on the size and dynamics of an economy, but say nothing about, for example, the distribution of income and wealth or possible adverse environmental effects of the economic activity.\" While Kenyatta's numbers are broadly correct, the way he uses them leaves out key context and tells an incomplete story. We rate this claim as misleading. \u2013Makinia Juma. Kenyatta said the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) was \"on course to achieve the record-shattering projection of KSh2 trillion by the end of the current financial year\". KRA records show that it collected KSh800.5 billion in the 2012/13 financial year. Treasury data as reported by the national statistics office gave a slightly lower figure of KSh763 million. The treasury publishes monthly data of actual revenue collected. The most recent shows that as of 28 April, total tax and non-tax revenue was KSh1.51 trillion, about KSh90 billion less than the president's figure. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's data agency regularly publishes power generation figures, sourced from the electricity utility Kenya Power and power-generating company KenGen . In 2013, total power generation, including imports, was 8,447 GWh (gigawatt hours). The most recent economic survey shows 12,414 GWh in 2021. The increase is about 1.5 times, not 40 times as the president claimed. We also found the installed capacity had risen from 1,717 MW (megawatts) in 2013 to a provisional figure of 2,989.6 MW in 2021. Kenya Power has 1,765 MW as of June 2013 and 2,984 MW in June 2021. Installed capacity is the maximum capacity that the electricity system is designed to run at. This would mean power capacity grew by about 1.7 times in the last nine years. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. \u2013 Tess Wandia The Water Services Regulatory Board provides data on water access. By law, the regulator is required to keep a national database of water services and report on water and sanitation every year. Its most recent report covers the 2019/20 financial year. This shows that 14.7 million people had access to water from water service providers. The president understated the figure by 1.7 million people and again missed a chance to claim even more progress. But the larger picture is worrying, with water coverage falling from 59% in 2018/19 to 57% in 2019/20. This only covers the utilities it regulates and was due to population growth, the board said. \u2013 Tess Wandia The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) provides medical insurance to its members. Payments to the fund are deducted from all Kenyans in formal employment. Kenyans in the informal sector pay at least KSh6,000 a year for fund membership. Kenyatta's written speech , on the presidency's website, claims that his government \"registered a 400% growth in the number of Kenyans insured under NHIF\" from 2013 to date. But when he read his speech he left out the percentage increase, dwelling only on the numbers \u2013 the rise in NHIF coverage from 4.4 million to 17.1 million. The fund provides membership returns to the national data agency. In 2012/13, Kenyatta's first year in office, the fund had 3.8 million members. The most recent report shows the fund has 10.1 million members, and 13.3 million dependents, that is, a declared spouse or child. The principal membership has increased by 166%, not 400% as claimed. And the number of Kenyans insured \u2013 principal members plus their dependents \u2013 is 23 million, not 17.1 million . We therefore rate this claim as incorrect.",

        "doc": "Kenya is grading its new system of government after the constitution created 47 new administrative units in 2010. These counties started to govern in 2013 and are now five years old. The chairperson of the Council of Governors, Josphat Nanok, reported on their progress in his June 2018 State of Devolution Address. We checked some of the claims he made in listing the counties' achievements. Claim \"It is important to note that up to the 2017/18 financial year, county governments have received cumulative of KSh1.25 trillion shillings as equitable share\u2026\" Verdict mostly-correct Kenyan law provides that no less than 15% of the revenue collected by the national government must go to the counties. Nanok's figure is half Kenya's most recent budget of KSh2.56 trillion . The 47 counties receive money from the national government following approval from the Office of the Controller of Budget . The money is split into an equitable share of the national revenue and grants. The payments are listed in the agency's budget implementation review reports . National government allocations to counties 2012-2018* Financial year Equitable share (in billion KSh) Conditional grants (billion KSh) 2012/13 9.7 6.7 2013/14 190 3.4 2014/15 226.66 2.6 2015/16 259.77 12.3 2016/17 280.3 19.4 2017/2018* 302 23.27 Total 1,268.83 67.67 *Figures obtained from the 2017/2018 half-year report SOURCE: Office of the Controller of Budget , Commission on Revenue Allocation Claim \"As a matter of clarity, we counties have been able [to] improve on our local revenues to augment the intergovernmental transfers from the national shareable revenues.\" Verdict mostly-correct Nanok said the counties were working to raise their own revenues. Counties raise funds from property rates, entertainment taxes and charges for services provided. Other levies are approved by parliament. Data from the the Office of the Controller of Budget shows that the counties' revenue collection largely improved from 2012 to 2016. There was a dip in the 2016/17 financial year. But the counties are yet to meet their revenue collection targets. Revenue collection by Kenya counties 2012-2018* Financial year Actual revenue (billion KSh) Target  (billion KSh) 2012/13 6.8 - 2013/14 26.3 54.23 2014/15 33.85 50.38 2015/16 35.02 50.54 2016/17 32.52 57.66 2017/18* 9.95 55.04 * 2018 half year figure. SOURCE: Budget Implementation Review Reports Claim \"We note that pneumonia, malaria and cancer continue to be the leading causes of registered deaths.\" Verdict unproven Out of the 189,087 deaths Kenya provisionally registered in 2017, the three diseases accounted for 29.7%. This is according to the Economic Survey 2018 . There were 21,584 deaths from pneumonia, 17,553 from malaria and 16,953 from cancer. HIV/Aids was the fourth leading cause of death. The figures are sourced from the civil registration department , which is under the interior ministry . But some 48% of deaths - 90,949 - were recorded as caused by \"other\". Asked for more information on this, interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said: \"I don't see how we can break down 'other' further than 'other'\". Additionally, not all deaths were registered. The national statistics office estimated that only 41.9% of all deaths that occurred in 2016 were captured. New study overturns survey data But a new study on mortality trends shows different leading causes of death in Kenya. Released in March 2018 by the health ministry, it reviewed medical  records of causes of death in 168 public hospitals from 2012 to 2016. It also recertified some of these records by looking at the medical files and not the death certificates, which may have been inaccurately filled. This is according to the head of the ministry's civil registration and vital statistics unit, Samuel Cheburet. \"Sometimes you just see 'pulmonary arrest' as the cause of death. We have to find out exactly what caused it,\" he said. In some instances local officials recorded causes of death based on what the families said, without evidence, he added. Low death registration coverage Of the 252,000 deaths in this period, 102,000 were recertified. The survey listed HIV/Aids (12%), lower respiratory tract infections (9.1%) and malaria (5.7%) as the leading causes of death. It gave no further details on the types of respiratory infections. Cancer  accounted for about 5.5% of deaths. The study shows that other causes of death, apart from disease, include falls, surgical mistakes, poisoning, fire, drowning, animal bites and crime. In some cases no one really knows, so the cause is entered as \"undetermined\". Together, these account for 29.1% of deaths. The study also notes that Kenya only registers 40% to 50% of deaths. Given this and the new study data, we rate the claim as unproven. Claim \"Our health worker proportion is therefore still below the ideal minimum health worker to population ratio of 23 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10,000 population recommended by WHO\u2026\" Verdict misleading This ratio was \"necessary to deliver maternal and child health services\", Nanok added. But the World Health Organisation has told Africa Check that it does not have a predetermined ratio for healthcare workers. \"There is no current recommendation for a predefined physician to population ratio,\" Dr Mathieu Boniol, a statistician with the WHO said. Meshack Ndolo, a senior health adviser at the council of governors, told Africa Check that the ratio had been used to show how many more doctors were needed in Kenya. This was \"because we were one of those countries that were designated as human resource for health crisis countries in 2006\", Ndolo said. He conceded that there was no prescribed ratio per se, citing WHO's Global strategy on human resources for health: Workforce 2030 . While Kenya's healthcare staff numbers are still short, experts have told Africa Check that the quality of healthcare is also significant. Claim \"Over the last 6 years, the forest cover has increased from 6.99% to 7.3%.\" Verdict unproven In 2013 Kenya's forest cover was 7.2%, and grew to 7.29% in 2017, according to the Economic Survey 2018. But an April 2018 resource assessment report from the environment ministry shows forest cover was at 6.99% in 2013, and 7.4% in 2016. Both reports cite data from the Kenya Forest Service , the state agency tasked with protecting and managing public forests. The discrepancy in official data is because there has not been a detailed study on forest cover, Monica Kalenda, the chief conservator of forests, told Africa Check. The most recent study was done in 2010 and its final report released in 2013, she said. This showed forest cover was 6.99% in 2010. \"We normally do a wall-to-wall mapping which is supposed to be done after every five years, but we have not done so because of resources. It is quite expensive,\" Kalenda said. As such, forest cover is based on projections from the 2010 data, she said. (Note: A 0.1 percentage point increase would be about 58,037 hectares, larger than the Kenyan county of Migori.)

        "doc": "Helen Zille, the leader of South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance, says her party has the \"best story to tell\" ahead of the 2014 general elections. Beginning of March 2014, the DA launched a campaign that drew heavily on its performance in the Western Cape, the only one of South Africa's nine provinces that is not held by the governing African National Congress. The DA maintains that the \"Western Cape Story\" highlights the \"great strides made in the province since 2009\" and \"really is a good story to tell\" , one that could become \"South Africa's story\" if the party comes to power. In a video released on 7 March 2014, the DA set out many of the claims that are key to the \"Western Cape Story\". Africa Check investigated them. This report forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on 7 May. Claim \"In the ANC's last year in government, not one department received a clean audit. In the DA's first year, seven departments received clean audits.\" Verdict correct In 2008/09 - the last year the ANC governed the Western Cape - the Auditor-General reported that not a single provincial government department had received a clean audit. In 2009/10 - the first year the Western Cape was run by the DA - the Auditor-General reported that seven departments had received clean audits. Claim \"The country's top three government departments since 2011 have all been in the Western Cape.\" Verdict correct Western Cape provincial government departments have occupied the top spots in the Annual Public Sector Reporting Awards since 2011. Both the 2011 and 2012 awards placed Western Cape departments in the top three positions. The Western Cape Department of Agriculture has scooped the top spot for two years running. Claim \"Under the ANC, not one department featured in the top three.\" Verdict incorrect Under the ANC, the Western Cape agriculture department and the treasury were placed second and third respectively in the 2007 Annual Public Sector Reporting Awards. The Western Cape Department of Local Government was placed second in the 2006 awards. Claim \"The Western Cape was ranked as the best run province in South Africa in 2013.\" Verdict correct The DA referred Africa Check to an assessment produced by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency which evaluated \"the quality of management practices across a comprehensive range of management areas, from supply chain management to strategic planning\". The assessment found that the Western Cape government scored highest out of all the provinces for strategic management, governance and accountability, human resources management and financial management. Claim \"The [Western Cape] was also the only province with no irregular or unauthorised spending.\" Verdict unproven The claim that the Western Cape was the only province in South Africa with \"no irregular or unauthorised spending\" in 2013 cannot be assessed as the Auditor-General's 2013/14 audit has yet to be finalised. Africa Check asked the DA what evidence it had to support the claim. To date the party has not responded. We will update this report if they do. Claim \"The Western Cape now has the highest access to water, flush toilets and electricity in the country.\" Verdict correct The 2011 national census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water. The Western Cape had the highest percentage of households with access to flush or chemical toilets at 92% . It was followed by Gauteng, where 86.5% of households had access to flush or chemical toilets. According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng. However, the claim does not acknowledge the already high level of delivery that the DA inherited when it wrested control of the province from the ANC in 2009. Claim \"The [Western Cape] also has the highest proportion of households receiving free basic water, free basic electricity and free basic sewerage and sanitation.\" Verdict correct The claim is correct, according to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA). In 2012 , 66.4% of Western Cape \"consumer units\" received free basic water. Nationally, only 37.1% of \"consumer units\" received free basic water. The Western Cape provided free basic electricity to 43.6% of \"consumer units\" in 2012. This was the highest in the country. Nationally, only 24.9% of \"consumer units\" received free basic electricity. While only 25.7% of \"consumer units\" in South Africa received free basic sewerage and sanitation, 67.7% of \"consumer units\" in the Western Cape received this free basic service, according to Stats SA. Claim \"In 2009, the ANC left the province with over 6,000 health department vacancies. The vacancy rate for nurses was 34%. By 2013, the DA had brought this down to just 1%.\" Verdict unproven This claim could not be independently verified. According to the Western Cape Department of Health's 2008/09 annual report ,  27,198 of 36,380 posts were filled, with 9,193 vacancies. Funding had not been provided for 8,549 of the vacancies and the annual report stated that their inclusion incorrectly \"inflated the vacancy rate\". The 2012/13 annual report stated that out of 31,733 posts, 30,345 were occupied and 1,388 were vacant. However, only vacancies for posts that had been funded were listed. The Western Cape Department of Health told Africa Check that there were no unfunded vacancies that year. If you compare the number of funded vacancies between the two years it appears that they have increased from 644 in 2009 to 1,388 in 2013. Cameron Arendse, Zille's spokesman in her capacity as party leader, told Africa Check that the claim that nursing vacancies stood at 34% in 2009 was sourced from the South African Institute of Race Relations' 2012 South Africa Survey . However, the survey attributes this vacancy rate to 2010, not 2009. The figure also exclude nursing assistants and student nurses. The Western Cape Department of Health's 2013/14 annual report \u2013 which could potentially verify the accuracy of the claim that the vacancy rate has dropped to 1% - has yet to be released. The DA referred us to two other supporting documents. Both are speeches, not primary sources. The first was a February 2014 address by the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, in which he claimed that the vacancy rate of permanent nurses had been brought down to less than 1%. The second was an October 2013 speech made by the Western Cape's minister of health, Theuns Botha. It stated that the vacancy rate had decreased to 5%. Neither claim could be independently verified. According to the department's latest annual report , vacancy rates stood at 3.68% for professional nurses, 2.95% for enrolled nurses and 2.47% for enrolling nursing auxiliaries. The DA's reasoning for citing speeches by its political leaders as primary sources was explained as follows by David Christianson, the party's senior research consultant: \"When DA [provincial ministers],  or the premier of the Western Cape, make factual claims, we (the party) believe them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary\u2026 As a result, in a party political state such as this, factual statements by DA MECs are given as sources.\" Claim \"The DA has increased ARV treatment in the Western Cape from 14,000 to 132,000.\" Verdict incorrect Questioned about the sourcing of the claim, the DA referred us to an article published by the South African Government News Agency in February last year which stated that the Western Cape had \"increased anti-retroviral treatment provision from 14,370 to 132,279\". The article did not provide a source for the data. But the Western Cape health department's annual reports contradict the claim. In 2008/09 , the last year the ANC held power in the Western Cape, anti-retroviral treatment was provided to 54,703 patients. In 2009/10 , the first year the DA was in office in the Western Cape, anti-retroviral treatment was provided to 75,002 patients. The 2012/13 annual report supports the DA's claim that treatment has increased to 132,000 patients. The annual report states that 134,212 patients were on anti-retroviral therapy in that year. Claim \"[The DA] has brought down the rate of mother to child HIV transmission to just 1.8%, the lowest in the country.\" Verdict correct The claim that the Western Cape has the lowest rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission in the country is correct, according to a 2011 study by the Medical Research Council. It found that the Western Cape had the lowest rate of mother-to-child transmission at 1.98%. The Northern Cape had the highest, at 6.06%, and the national average was 2.67%. Claim \"In its first term in office, the DA built three brand new hospitals in Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain and George and currently has 75 health care projects valued at R4.5 billion underway.\" Verdict exaggerated The claim is slightly exaggerated. The Khayelitsha Hospital opened in April 2012 and the Mitchells Plain Hospital opened in November 2013. However, a new hospital wasn't built in George. A new emergency unit was added to an existing hospital in July 2012. The Western Cape's 2014-2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement states that over the next three years approximately R3 billion will be invested in health infrastructure. Claim \"While the broad unemployment rate in South Africa is a staggering 34%, the Western Cape has a broad unemployment rate of 22%.\" Verdict correct The last Quarterly Labour Force Survey of 2014 indicates that South Africa's broad unemployment rate stood at 34% in the fourth quarter, compared to 22.1% in the Western Cape. Broad unemployment stood at 43.3% in the Eastern Cape and 42.2% in the Free State. Claim \"Since the end of 2012, South Africa's unemployed population has grown by 121,000. In the Western Cape the unemployed population has shrunk by 48,000.\" Verdict correct Stats SA's latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey shows that the number of people in South Africa who are unemployed increased by 121,000 between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013. Unemployment figures in the Western Cape fell from 641,000 at the end of 2012 to 593,000 at the end of 2013. Note: South Africa's official employment data has not been without controversy and economists and the country's Reserve Bank have reportedly expressed scepticism about Stats SA's numbers . Claim \"Under-performing schools are schools where the matric pass rate is less than 60%. Under the ANC this went from 36 schools in 2006 to 85 in 2009. In just four years the DA brought the number of underperforming schools down to 23.\" Verdict mostly-correct According to data compiled by the national Department of Basic Education, there were 34 under-performing schools in 2006, 84 in 2009 and 23 in 2013. Claim \"Since 2009 there has been a 25% increase in the number of candidates from poorer schools to pass the National Senior Certificate exams. In Khayelitsha alone, the number of passes has gone up by almost 1,000 since 2009.\" Verdict mostly-correct The Western Cape Department of Education told Africa Check that the claim refers to quintiles one, two and three schools. The quintile system gives a ranking to schools according to poverty levels. \"Quintile one\" schools are considered the most poor while \"quintile five\" schools are the least poor. In a January 2013 press release, Western Cape education minister Donald Grant said the number of passes in quintile one to three schools had increased from 7,798 in 2009 to 9,797 in 2012 - a 25% increase. Data compiled by the national Department of Basic Education shows that 9,131 pupils passed in 2012, not 9,797 as claimed by the DA. However, Dr Rufus Poliah, chief director of national examinations and assessments in the Department of Basic Education, told Africa Check that the figures reported by the Western Cape Department of Education would be more accurate than the national department's data. \"It is their schools and they work more closely with them,\" he said. The number of pupils in quintile one to three schools in the Western Cape that passed the National Senior Certificate exams in 2009 could not be verified. The national department does not have updated quintile information prior to 2012. But other data from the basic education department does show that in 2009, 1,343 pupils passed matric in Khayelitsha schools. In 2013, this increased by 833 to 2,176 passes. Claim \"Under the DA, the matric science pass rate went from 53% to 73%. The maths pass rate went from 65% to 73%.\" Verdict correct Department of Basic Education data confirms that the DA's claim is correct. The physical science pass rate improved from 53% in 2009 to 72.6% in 2013 and the mathematics pass rate increased from 65% to 73.3%.

        "doc": "President Uhuru Kenyatta \u2013 with the presidency's Andrew Wakahiu \u2013 talked up his administration's achievements at an event in the Mount Kenya region, his political base. Their claim about how much money the counties have received under Kenyatta is understated, although the figure for the annual amount given to the 10 Mount Kenya counties is correct. It's mostly correct that Mount Kenya counties got KSh39 billion in 2013, when Kenyatta took office. But the president's claim about the scale of economic growth over his two terms is misleading. There are no permanent allies or enemies, only permanent interests, the well-travelled saying goes . An example of this is the lead up to Kenya's August 2022 elections. Outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta is campaigning hard for Raila Odinga, his former fierce rival . On 23 February 2022 , Kenyatta was in his political backyard of Mount Kenya to convince his supporters to back Odinga. In the meeting at the Sagana State Lodge , the president made claims about his legacy, specifically the economy. He also brought in Andrew Wakahiu , the head of the president's delivery unit , to outline his government's contributions to the prosperity of the region. \"Mount Kenya\" refers to a vote-rich political construct of the Kikuyu, Meru and Embu communities, and counties where these communities are the majority. There are officially 10 Mount Kenya counties. These are Tharaka-Nithi, Meru, Nyeri, Laikipia, Nakuru, Murang'a, Kiambu, Nyandarua, Embu and Kirinyaga. Kenyatta and Wakahiu made several claims. We checked four. Wakahiu played up the national government's work in Mount Kenya. Speaking in the Kikuyu language, he claimed there had been progress in equipping hospitals and building markets, polytechnics and roads. Africa Check contacted Wakahiu for the source of their data. He asked us to send an email, but despite several reminders he is yet to respond. We'll update this report when he does. Kenya's 47 county governments get money from the national government in two ways: Monthly payouts from the national treasury shared equitably across counties Conditional grants as set out in the county allocation of revenue act These funds are called \"exchequer issues\". The figures are recorded in monthly treasury bulletins and in the controller of budget 's annual reports . Kenya's county governments were established in March 2013. The most recent full financial year ended in June 2021. Between these dates, the data shows , the national government gave KSh535.8 billion (US$4.67 billion) to the 10 Mount Kenya counties. Kenya's financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June of the following year. For the current financial year, 2021/22, the national government has so far allocated KSh34.6 billion to the 10 counties. The total amount of money given to the Mount Kenya counties as of 31 January 2022 is therefore KSh570.4 billion. This figure would have been available to Wakahiu when he made the claim. Money disbursed to the 10 M oun t Kenya counties since 2013 County Amount (Ksh) Embu 42,525,553,879 Kiambu 100,538,137,066 Kirinyaga 37,962,208,688 Laikipia 40,334,553,446 Meru 70,760,018,613 Murang'a 55,731,425,415 Nakuru 94,395,398,722 Nyandarua 43,259,857,637 Nyeri 52,725,973,149 Tharaka Nithi 32,200,827,916 TOTAL 570,433,954,531 Wakahiu understated the figure, missing a chance to claim even more gains. Wakahiu said the national government's annual transfers to the Mount Kenya counties had risen to KSh81 billion, from KSh39 billion when Kenyatta took office in 2013. The data shows that over the last three financial years, the 10 counties received an average of KSh81.7 billion. The claim is correct. The first full financial year under the Kenyatta administration was 2013/14. In that time, the 10 Mount Kenya counties received KSh40.4 billion , according to data from the country's controller of budget. In the three months after Kenyatta's election in March 2013, the counties got KSh2.5 billion. Kenya's economic performance under Kenyatta continues to be scrutinised . The country's rising debt is also a source of public concern . The president played up his record by saying he had more than doubled the size of the economy during his tenure. \"Kibaki left me an economy worth KSh5 trillion. Today the one I hand over my government to, I will leave an economy worth KSh13 trillion,\" Kenyatta said in the Kikuyu language. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a widely used measure of the health of an economy. It is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. Kenya's national statistics office gives the size of the country's economy as KSh4.7 trillion in 2013. The most recent annual statistics survey provisionally estimates GDP to be KSh10.8 trillion in 2020, a figure also used by the World Bank. The national treasury provisionally estimates that GDP will be KSh12.6 trillion in 2022. Kenyatta is set to leave office this year, after serving the constitutional limit of two terms. While these numbers appear to support the claim, they only tell half the story. First, Kenya's GDP was rebased twice in the period between 2013 and 2022 \u2013 in 2014 and in 2021 . This was to account for changes in \"new sectors, new products and new technologies, and consumer behaviour and tastes \u2026 over time\". Dr Abraham Rugo is the Kenya country manager for the International Budget Partnership , a budget transparency think tank. He told Africa Check the rebasing \"measures productive elements of the economy that were not measured before\". \"Not all of it is new growth,\" Rugo said. \"This is a case where Kenyatta is giving the right numbers in the wrong context. The nuance about the rebasing is missing.\" Africa Check has previously explained the problem with using GDP as a measure of economic progress. ( Note: Also see box below. ) 'Think of it as a credit card economy' Rugo also highlighted the increase in debt. \"There has been a lot of economic activity, in building the railway and roads, but a lot of it is funded through borrowed money. Think of it as a credit card economy,\" he said, signalling the repayments will put a strain on the economy. Prof Charles Wheelan is a senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the US and author of Naked Statistics , among other works. He told Africa Check that ignoring the effect of rebasing and a debt-fuelled economy when discussing GDP numbers gives a partial picture. \"If [the rebasing] is not taken into account, then the comparison is apples to oranges,\" Wheelan said. He agreed the brisk increase in debt to fund projects under the Kenyatta administration should also be considered. \"The indebtedness matters, too; there are plenty of countries that have had debt-fuelled spells of growth only to end up with a fiscal crisis later on when the debt can't be paid off,\" Wheelan said. In a February 2022 report , Kenya's national treasury puts the country's total public debt at KSh8.2 trillion by December 2021. How should a president use GDP to show economic progress? \"Real\" GDP, which considers inflation, is a better way to measure economic growth, according to Prof Charles Wheelan , a senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the US. Naked Statistics is one of his many books. President Kenyatta used \"nominal\" GDP, which ignores changes in inflation and population growth. Both are key factors in calculating GDP. Not taking inflation into account usually distorts the value of an economy, John Kinuthia, a senior programmes officer at the International Budget Partnership (IBP), has previously told Africa Check. Per capita GDP \u2013 total GDP divided by the population\u2013 could also be used, said Dr Abraham Rugo, the IBP's Kenya country manager . But he warned that it created an inaccurate picture, as it downplayed or ignored inequalities in the population. Kinuthia told Africa Check it was worth looking at the revenue data relative to the GDP, to check if the claimed economic growth was reflected in how much money the government made. In 2013, with a GDP of KSh4.7 trillion, government revenues totalled KSh1 trillion , just 21% of GDP.  In 2020 with a GDP of KSh10.8 trillion, the revenues were KSh1.9 trillion , 18% of GDP. This means that while the size of the economy was said to have doubled in nominal terms, government revenue shrank. This was perhaps a result of jobless growth \u2013 when GDP grows but employment doesn't \u2013 and a debt-fuelled economy, Rugo said. An explainer on the International Monetary Fund website says: \"When GDP is growing, especially if inflation is not a problem, workers and businesses are generally better off than when it is not.\" Based on the data and expert insight, we rate the president's claim as misleading.",

        "doc": "Kenyatta cited statistics to back up claims of his administration's achievements. We are awaiting the source of his data, requested from his office. His claim that 5.3 million title deeds to land were issued in just eight years is mostly correct. But claims that police coverage of communities is the highest in Kenya's history, and the economy was shielded from the global pandemic slowdown, are incorrect. Claims about increased numbers of healthcare workers and hospital beds remain unproven until we receive the source of the president's data. In October 2021 Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta was in Kirinyaga county, about 100 kilometres northeast of the capital Nairobi, to mark Mashujaa \u2013 Heroes' \u2013 Day . In his speech , Kenyatta highlighted his administration's milestones since he took office in April 2013. Kenya holds elections in August 2022. We fact-checked six claims he made, ranging from policing and economic growth to the health workforce and land ownership. We have asked State House for the data Kenyatta based his claims on and will update this report with their response. Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna told Africa Check the information was from the national statistics bureau but did not give any more details. The \"transformation\" of Kenya's security sector was one of his notable achievements, Kenyatta said . He gave the country's police-to-population ratio as evidence of this, saying it was \"at its highest level\" in history and even higher than the \"UN prescribed standard\". The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. When Kenyatta came to power in 2013 there were 75,325 police officers in Kenya, according to the national police service . That year Kenya's population was 41.8 million, official data shows . This made for a police-to-population ratio of one officer for every 555 people. In 2016 the national police service commission said there were 90,442 police officers. The population was 45.4 million, for a ratio of 1:502. In 2017, Africa Check found that the president had incorrectly claimed that there was one police officer for every 390 people. The ratio was between 1:448 and 1:489. And in 2018, there were 105,867 officers serving a population of 46.4 million, for a ratio of 1:439. The most recent economic survey put the number of police officers at 100,481 in 2020. The estimated population was 48.7 million , for a police-to-population ratio of 1:485. The survey, published in September 2021, gave its source as the police service. Our efforts to contact the new police spokesperson have been unsuccessful. The available data shows that while the ratio has improved during the president's term, it was at its highest in 2018. We therefore rate his claim as incorrect. No evidence UN has a recommended police ratio Is the ratio higher than that \"prescribed\" by the United Nations ? Africa Check has previously found that the UN has never recommended a ratio. The often-used ratio of 1:450 was traced back to post-war US policing of occupied Germany in 1945, according to a 1995 paper . It has since been used as a \"doctrinal template for international policing\" but it is not a UN \"recommendation\". Experts have told Africa Check that such a recommendation would have little meaning given countries' significant differences in police functions and capabilities, and the security challenges they face. Instead, the quality of policing is a better indicator of policing effectiveness. Kenyatta said the \"basket of stimulus instruments\" his administration rolled out during the Covid-19 pandemic had shielded Kenya's economy from the economic slowdown seen elsewhere. \"While the global economy contracted by an average of 3.6% last year, we still managed to grow our economy by 0.3% over the same period,\" he said . Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , directed us to the most recent economic survey published in September 2021 for data on economic growth. The survey says the global economy contracted by 4.2% in 2020. Kenya's also shrank, by 0.3%. World Bank data shows a contraction of 3.5% for the global economy, but the same negative growth of 0.3% for Kenya. Kenya's economy posted negative growth in 2020. We therefore rate the claim incorrect. Kenya's increased number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds was an \"unintended benefit\" of the Covid-19 pandemic, the president said . In his delivered speech , he said the rise was from 180 to 651 beds. But the text version gives it as from 108 beds. Dr Kahura Mundia is the deputy chairperson of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU). He told Africa Check that the council of governors would have the most recent data on ICU beds. The World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. On 1 April the governors' council reported that there were 162 ICU beds in 24 of the country's 47 counties. Twenty-two counties did not have any ICU beds, it said. Two weeks later a senate report on the country's handling of the pandemic said Kenya had 518 ICU beds \"spread across 79 public and private health facilities\" . It cited the health ministry. A year later Africa Check looked into the numbers . The available data showed Kenya had at least 596 ICU beds \u2013 390 in the counties and 206 in major Nairobi hospitals. On 30 September 2021, the governors reported there were 570 ICU beds across all counties. The number was only for county-run health facilities, not private ones. Therefore, according to the governors, county ICU beds increased from 162 to 570 in 18 months \u2014 a rise of 252%. The number of ICU beds in Kenya was not 108 or even 180 when the pandemic was declared. And we have not seen any data to support a national 502% increase in ICU bed numbers, despite searching widely. We therefore rate the president's claim as unproven. Kenyatta said the number of hospital beds had risen 47% since 2013. We asked the KMPDU's Kahura where we could find data on hospital beds. He directed us to the most recent economic survey from the national data agency. The data shows that hospital bed numbers increased from 64,844 in 2016 to 82,091 in 2020. The statistics bureau cites a master list of the country's health facilities, compiled by the health ministry , as the source of its data. Hospital beds in Kenya 2016 to 2020 Year Hospital beds Increase 2016 64,844 - 2017 67,195 2,351 2018 71,601 4,406 2019 74,868 3,267 2020 82,091 7,223 Source: Kenya National Bureau of Statistics The economic survey was released in September 2021, a month before the president's speech. We scoured for data for 2013 but came up empty. The number of hospital beds rose by an average of over 4,000 each year from 2016 to 2020. This makes it plausible that, over nine years, the beds could have increased by as much as Kenyatta claimed. But without the 2013 data, we cannot verify this. We have asked State House for more information and will update this report with their response. Until then, we rate the claim as unproven. The president claimed his administration had nearly doubled the number of healthcare workers in the nearly nine years he has been in office. He did not say what the number was in 2013 but his claim would put it at about 38,000. The World Health Organization defines health workers as \"all those engaged in action whose primary intent is health\". They fall, it says , broadly into \"dentistry, pharmacy, laboratory, environment and public health, community and traditional health, health management and support, and all other health workforce categories\". A 2013 Kenyan health ministry report lists nearly 40 \"cadres\" of health workers, including doctors, nurses, clinical officers, social workers, pharmacists and pharmaceutical technologists. The KMPDU's Kahura told Africa Check that the national statistics agency compiles data on registered healthcare workers. But data on the public health workforce was difficult to find, he said. Numbers contradictory and difficult to come by In 2013 the government mapped out its health capacity. It found that there were 67,075 health workers in all public, private and faith-based health facilities, but did not break the number down further. The health ministry was more specific in its human resources strategy for 2014 to 2018, dated December 2014. It said that in 2012, there were 58,532 medical personnel, 47,895 of them employed by the government. The health strategy report for 2018 to 2023 says that \"as at November 2018, Kenya had 68,085 health workers in the public sector and 10,626 in the private sector, totalling 78,711\". We were unable to get the source of the president's claim that there were 75,000 public health workers in October 2021. Using all the available data, a jump from 47,895 in 2012 to 75,000 in 2021 \u2013 assuming the president's number is correct \u2013 is an additional 27,105 workers, or 57%. It's not 36,900 or \"nearly 100%\", as he claimed. But again, without clarity from Kenyatta's office, we rate the claim as \"unproven\". According to the ministry of lands and physical planning , 5.1 million title deeds to land were issued between 2013 and 2021. From 2013 to April 2020, the ministry says , over 4.4 million titles were issued. Only the ministry can confirm the number of deeds it has issued, the Kenya Land Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation that advocates for land reform in the country, told Africa Check. Africa Check previously asked the lands minister if the 5.1 million figure was the latest data on title deeds issued since 2013, but we have not yet received a response. She had given us figures up to June 2019. Based on the available data, Kenyatta's claim that his administration has issued 5.3 million title deeds in eight years is mostly correct.",

        "doc": "Piped water and rising expectations Claim \"When 95% of households have access to water, the 5% who still need to be provided for, feel they cannot wait a moment longer. Success is also the breeding ground of rising expectations.\" Verdict incorrect This was an odd statement. Without \"access to water\" people die. It follows that all South Africans therefore have some or other \"access to water\", be it piped, bottled, from water tankers, rain water tanks, streams or dams. What exactly Zuma meant by the phrase was unclear, as was the source of his claim. We examined a number of similar claims in a report published in 2013 . South Africa's then water and environmental affairs minister, Edna Molewa, previously claimed that 94.7% of South Africans have access to \"clean and safe drinking water\". Her spokesman, Mava Scott, claimed in 2013 that 96.4% of all households had access to \"piped water\". The 2011 national census put the figure of households with \"access to piped water\" at 91.2%. The 2012 general household survey stated that 90.8% of households had \"access to piped water\". The figures differ from province to province. In the Eastern Cape, for instance, only 79% of households were found to have access to piped water. When we spoke to him in 2013, Scott explained that \"[w]hen we talk about piped water, we are normally referring to infrastructure and people have access to water coming out of that infrastructure\" . As recent violent water protests in South Africa's North West province have shown, having a tap in your yard, home or street, doesn't mean you have water or that the water is \"clean and safe\". Nationally there has been growing dissatisfaction over the quality of water. According to the 2012 general household survey only \"60.1% of households rated the quality of water-related services they received as 'good'\". \"Satisfaction has, however, been eroding steadily since 2005 when 76.4% of users rated the services as good. Residents of Free State, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape have consistently been least satisfied with the quality of water. In 2012, 15.1% of households in Free State felt that their water smelled bad compared to 11.7% of Mpumalanga households and only 2.4% of Gauteng households. Free State households were most likely to feel that their water was unsafe to drink (15.1%), not clear (16.5%) and not tasting well (15.2%).\" Zuma's suggestion that violent service delivery protests could be attributed to the \"rising expectations\" of the \"5% who still need to be provided for\", was characterised as \"spin-doctoring\" by a number of political commentators and opposition parties following his State of the Nation address. Three million houses delivered Claim \"In housing, about 3 million housing units and more than 855,000 serviced sites were delivered since 1994 [up to December 2013].\" Verdict correct The department of performance monitoring and evaluation's 2012 development indicators showed that about 3.3-million housing units had either been completed or were \"in progress\". According to Xolani Xundu, a spokesman in the department of human settlements, 2,799,702 \"houses and units\" were delivered from 1994 to December 2013. He told Africa Check last year the number of \"serviced sites\" delivered over that period came to 876,774. A 2013 report by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) pointed out that housing figures from different government sources were often contradictory. Five hundred informal settlements replaced Claim \"Nearly 500 informal settlements have been replaced with quality housing and basic services over the past five years.\" Verdict unproven According to the department of human settlements the figure was correct, but the data did not exist in a single collated form, and referred only to basic services as it did not necessarily include housing. The department's Victor Rajkumar told Africa Check at the time that there were \"myriad source documents\" from which the department gathered its information. While no \"list\" existed showing that 500 informal settlements had been upgraded, Rajkumar said data from various sources indicated \"at least 500 interventions or upgrading interventions\" in informal settlements. Defining the extent and status of informal settlements in South Africa remains a contentious issue. The baseline used to measure the number of informal settlements in South Africa dates from 2009. It states that there are approximately 2,700 informal settlements across the country, and that households in these settlements continue to grow at around 3% per annum. A report from the Housing Development Agency suggested that the number of households living in informal settlements had stabilised since 2001. In 2011 there were approximately 1.66-million households in informal residential areas or shacks not in a backyard. Kate Tissington from the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) told Africa Check last year that while government \"likes to talk about upgrading settlements\", the reality was that very little had been done. According to Tissington, \"delivery figures around informal settlement upgrading are often very ambiguous, sometimes referring to formal housing projects and often hiding the removal of people from settlements and the growth of households living in backyard shacks\".

        "doc": "With Kenya's August 2022 election only two weeks away, the main contenders have been spiritedly debating their agendas. We looked at 16 claims made during a much-watched debate for running mates of the four presidential candidates. It was a mixed scorecard which included some major bloopers. The state of official data is a concern, with conflicting numbers a regular occurrence. Ahead of the 9 August general election, Kenya's four running mates took to the lecterns to promote their agendas in nationally televised debates. Martha Karua of the Azimio la Umoja coalition squared off with Rigathi Gachagua of the United Democratic Alliance party. Karua, a former justice minister, is the running mate of former Kenyan prime minister Raila Odinga , while Gachagua, the member of parliament for Mathira constituency, is the running mate of deputy president William Ruto . Odinga and Ruto are the perceived frontrunners according to opinion polls. Two other candidates, Justina Wamae of Roots Party and Ruth Mutua of Agano Party , also debated each other. Wamae and Mutua are the presidential running mates of George Wajackoyah and David Mwaure . We identified 16 claims made in the debates. Martha Karua Kenya does \"not have a revenue problem,\" Karua said in response to questions from debate moderators about the high cost of living in Kenya \"We have an expenditure problem.\" She proceeded to illustrate this. \"This year alone we collected over KSh2 trillion,\" she said . Karua's office told Africa Check she was referring to the 2021/22 financial year, the most recent revenue data released about two weeks before the debate, and not a calendar year. Kenya's financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June. On 7 July 2022 the Kenya Revenue Authority announced it had collected KSh2.03 trillion (about US$17 billion at current rates) in taxes for the 2021/22 financial year. It described the amount as a record high. Total tax revenue collected in last five financial years Financial year Amount (KShs trillion) 2017/18 1.52 2018/19 1.71 2019/20 1.8 2020/21 1.78 2021/22 2 SOURCE: Kenya Economic Survey 2022 . *Figures are rounded up. We rate the claim correct. \u2014Alphonce Shiundu Karua promised to curb non-priority expenditure if elected. \"The expenditure for operations and maintenance (O&M) is over KSh600 billion,\" she said . The independent office of the controller of budget oversees budget implementation in the country. It categorises operations and maintenance as spending on, among others, domestic and foreign travel, advertising, rent, legal fees and maintenance for motor vehicles and other assets. The controller of budget has data on both the national government and the 47 county governments. The most recent publicly available annual data is for the 2020/21 financial year. The data showed spending on operations and maintenance was KSh218.7 billion for the national government and KSh105.9 billion for the counties, adding up to KSh324.6 billion. The budget office has also published data for the first nine months of the 2021/22 financial year. This had the national government spending KSh253.6 billion on operations and maintenance. Counties spent KSh73.3 billion, making for a total expenditure of KSh326.9 billion. As the source of their data, Karua's office directed us to the national treasury. Her campaign also shared this table showing operations and maintenance expenditure as KSh558.6 billion in the 2020/21 financial year, against a budget of KSh587.4 billion. Treasury's most recent figures are in the quarterly economic report published in May 2022. Part of the report shows spending on operations and maintenance exceeded KSh600 billion in 2018/19, and is estimated to have been KSh652 billion in 2020/21. But there's an \"other\" line item included in the O&M figures, and it is unclear what this refers to. We have contacted the treasury seeking clarity. The disparity in figures has also sparked debate on social media. Until we hear back from treasury we rate this claim unproven. \u2013Makinia Juma Karua said salaries gobble up about KSh550 billion. The office of the controller of budget publishes data on compensation for all national and county government employees. The information covers \"basic salaries for permanent employees, wages for temporary employees and personal allowances paid as part of salary among other payments to staff\". ( Note: Salaries for the army and intelligence services are not included \"due to the nature of their operations\". ) In 2020/21, KSh489.1 billion was spent on national government employees, and KSh176 billion on those in the counties. The total is KSh665.1 billion. The most recent data for a full financial year - 2020/21 - exceeds Karua's claim by more than KSh100 billion. The controller of budget also has partial data for the most recent financial year. For the first nine months of 2021/22, pay worked out to KSh368.5 billion for national government employees and KSh139.6 billion for county employees, making for a total of KSh508.1 billion. Karua's office shared a table with us that showed salaries and wages in 2020/21 were KSh493 billion. We also found a national treasury report with the same figure . However, the most recent economic survey gave the public sector wage bill at KSh711.7 billion in 2020, and provisionally at KSh760.1 billion in 2021. We have again asked the national treasury for the best document to use and will update this report with their response. Until then, we rate the claim as unproven. Karua then said spending on operations and maintenance was higher than the amount spent on employee compensation. Given the conflicting figures from the national treasury that we have outlined, we rate this claim as unproven pending official clarification. Rigathi Gachagua Gachagua said if his side wins elections, the focus would be on fixing the country's economy. \"We are inheriting a KSh9 trillion debt,\" he said . Is the country's public debt at this level? In its most recent debt update published in May 2022, the country's treasury said public debt was KSh8.4 trillion, or $73.5 billion at the prevailing exchange rate, as of 31 March 2022. Data for the full 2021/22 financial year, which ended 30 June, is yet to be published. On 19 July, the day of the debate, the International Monetary Fund published a report on the state of the Kenyan economy after meeting the country's officials. This put public debt at the end of the 2021/22 financial year at just over KSh9 trillion. Before it went on indefinite recess due to the impending elections, Kenya's parliament raised the debt ceiling from KSh9 trillion to KSh10 trillion to allow the treasury to bridge a KSh846 billion budget deficit for the 2022/23 financial year. We therefore rate Gachagua's estimate as mostly correct. \u2014 Dancan Bwire Gachagua said his party would also \"inherit\" six million young people who have no jobs\" if it formed the next government. Kenya's constitution defines the youth as those aged 18 to 34. The country's statistics office collects unemployment data. Its most recent labour force report , published in May 2021, covers the first three months of that year. It showed a total working-age population \u2013 those aged 15 to 64 \u2013 of 28 million people. There were 10,989,505 young people in the potential labour force, that is those willing and able to work. This latter figure includes those with and without jobs, and both available and unavailable job seekers. Of these, 9,085,653 were employed. This leaves about 1.9 million without jobs. Only 959,889 were listed as unemployed because they had sought work and missed out. Further, the report showed that three million young people aged 15 to 34  \"were not in the education system and were not working or being trained for work\". Ruto's campaign shared this table with Africa Check showing that 5.1 million people were unemployed and underemployed. The table, from the national statistics office, was published in 2018 with data from the 2015/16 integrated household budget survey. There's only one problem: the figure is for all Kenyans without jobs, not just young people. Those aged between 15-34 then were about 3.5 million. The most recent publicly available data does not support the claim that six million young people have no jobs. As we have often found , definitions can be an issue when held up against people's difficult experiences of the economy. \u2014 Dancan Bwire \"CRB\" refers to the Credit Reference Bureaus. These are firms which collect information on borrowers. Kenya's central bank has licensed three such firms: CreditInfo CRB , Metropol CRB and Transunion Kenya CRB . The bank acknowledged our request for data but was yet to respond at the time of publishing. This claim was first made in the Business Daily in a 2 February 2021 article . The Kenyan newspaper said Metropol data showed \"the number of loans accounts in arrears for more than 90 days had jumped to 14,035,718 by January this year\". Ruto's campaign also confirmed the article was the source of Gachagua's claim. However, Kenyan television station KTN News debunked the claim. The station interviewed Sam Omukoko , Metropol's group managing director, who said the 14 million figure was the number of loan accounts, not people. \"No, I think the figure that was reported was referring to the number of blacklisted accounts, not the number of people who have been blacklisted,\" Omukoko said on 16 February 2021. \"On average when you check through the bureau of records, Kenyans have an average of about five accounts, borrowing from banks, MFIs [and] saccos,\" Omukoko said . MFIs refers to microfinance institutions, while saccos are savings and credit societies. \"So you may find an account in the bank is in default but an account in the sacco is performing well or an MFI is performing well. So, that is the kind of thing that we are talking about. It was not about the number of people who have defaulted and been listed in the credit reference bureaus ,\" he said . He said the \"average default figure\" was three million, but did not clarify if this referred to accounts or people. Africa Check has contacted Omukoko about this. In the meantime we rate Gachagua's claim as incorrect. \u2014 Grace Gichuhi Dr Timothy Njagi is a development economist and research fellow at Tegemeo Institute , an agriculture and development policy think tank affiliated to Kenya's Egerton University . He has written extensively about food security in Kenya. To help verify this claim, Njagi directed Africa Check to the food balance sheet published annually in the economic survey by the country's data agency . It shows the demand and supply of food in the country. Kenyans consume maize as flour, as green maize on the cob, and as loose maize grains. Part of the maize is also used as animal feed,  as planting seed, processed (such as into corn oil), and part is lost because it goes bad. In 2020, total maize consumption was 4,215,000 tonnes , equivalent to 46.8 million bags, each weighing 90 kilograms. The most recent economic survey put the consumption in 2020 at 4,007,000 tonnes , or 44.5 million bags of maize. Njagi also directed us to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization . The most recent data on maize consumption is from 2019. It shows Kenya had 4,120,341 tonnes or 45.8 million bags of maize, each weighing 90 kilograms. We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct. \u2014Alphonce Shiundu The Kenya national bureau of statistics releases annual figures of maize production. These can be found in its flagship economic survey published every year. Bags weigh 90 kilograms. The most recent survey provisionally estimates that in 2021, the country produced 36.7 million bags. Maize production in Kenya 2015-2021 Year No. of 90kg bags (million) 2015 42.5 2016 37.8 2017 35.4 2018 44.6 2019 44 2020 42.1 2021* 36.7 Source:  Economic survey 2020 , 2021 , 2022 . *provisional The average production across six years for which we have complete data (2015-2020) is 41.1 million bags. If we include the provisional estimate for 2021, the average works out to 40.4 million bags. Gachagua is therefore correct that the country produces \"about 40 million\" bags of maize a year. \u2014Alphonce Shiundu Data on maize imports is contained in the food balance sheet published in the economic survey, Tegemeo Institute's Timothy Njagi told Africa Check. The most recent survey put imports in 2020 at 339,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million bags each weighing 90 kilograms. The FAO data also showed that in 2019, the country imported 265,000 metric tonnes or 2.9 million 90-kilogram bags. We therefore rate the claim incorrect. \u2014Alphonce Shiundu John Kinuthia is a senior programmes officer at the Kenyan office of the International Budget Partnership , a budget transparency think tank. For data on this claim , he directed us to the treasury's annual debt management reports . The most recent was published in September 2021. It showed interest paid on domestic debt rose from KSh139.8 billion in 2015 to KSh315.5 billion in 2020. In June 2021, the provisional figure was KSh388.8 billion, a figure also used by  the International Monetary Fund in a 19 July 2022 report . The IMF also projected that by June 2022, the government would have paid KSh464 billion in interest, against a budget of KSh479.2 billion. But Gachagua's campaign told Africa Check he was referring to the total interest cost, for both domestic and foreign debt. \"The actual figure for the current financial year 2022/23 is KSh690 billion comprising KSh553 billion and KSh137 billion domestic and foreign interest respectively,\" the campaign told Africa Check, and shared a link to this report from the parliamentary budget office . The IMF report has the figure for 2021/22 at KSh605 billion and cites the budget figure of KSh690 billion in 2022/23. These figures are in billions not millions. Gachagua's figure is therefore way off the mark. \u2014Makinia Juma Justina Wamae In response to a question on her leadership ability, Wamae said \"5.5 million Kenyans are unemployed\" and she wanted to speak for them. Wamae appears to have picked the figure from the 2015/16 labour force report published in 2018. It shows 5.1 million as having been unemployed and under-employed over time. However, labour statisticians at the national data office told Africa Check that the quarterly labour force survey has the most recent data on unemployment. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics' \" strict \" definition of unemployment is  \"people who do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the past four weeks, and are currently available for work\". The survey, published in September 2021, put the number of unemployed at between 1.3 million and 2.5 million. The data covered January to March 2021. Based on this data, we rate Wamae's claim as incorrect. \u2013 Makinia Juma Wamae also addressed the plight of poor Kenyans. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as those living on less than US$1.90 per day . This is roughly equivalent to KSh220 per day at current rates. Kenya's official data agency defines overall poverty as those who spend KSh3,252 a month in rural areas or KSh5,995 in urban areas. This works out to between KSh108 in rural areas and KSh200 in urban areas every day. The most recent official statistics released in 2018, had data for 2015/16. This gave the national poverty headcount rate as 36.1%, or 16.4 million people. An estimated 6.2 million Kenyans fell into poverty as a result of the Covid pandemic, according to a 2021 report by the Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis , a government think tank. A 2022 World Bank report estimated that 18.9 million people, or 34.3% of Kenyans lived on KSh220 a day. The bank said that Kenya's economy was severely disrupted by Covid but that the country has staged a strong recovery. \"Poverty rate is projected to fall below its pre-pandemic level in 2022,\" part of the report reads . Wamae's figure is incorrect. - Dancan Bwire Wamae's Root Party has campaigned on a platform of legalising marijuana . During the debate, she deflected criticism that marijuana affects the mental health of users, saying there were also \"mental challenges\" arising from the high cost of living and unemployment. Wamae said statistics show that \"three million Kenyans suffer from mental challenges\". Kenya's mental health policy , which covers 2015 to 2030, notes \"there is inadequate data and information on the prevalence of mental health, neurological, and substance use in Kenya\". The policy cited a 2011 report from the Kenyan National Human rights Commission which said \"there's no data on mental health prevalence in Kenya\". A 2019 health ministry taskforce on mental health recommended the \"integration of a mental health information sub-system within the general health and other information systems\". It also called for regular national surveys to better capture data. Mary Bitta is a doctoral candidate at the department of psychiatry at Oxford University in the UK. She told us that based on data from studies that have conducted community based surveys using random samples in Kenya, \"it is likely that the three million, which is roughly 6% of Kenya's population, is an under-estimate\". Bitta directed us to a study done in western Kenya which found a prevalence of common mental disorders of 10.8%. She also shared another 2017 study conducted among children in Kilifi county in the coastal region of Kenya. This found a prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems in children aged 6 to 9 to be 13%. \"If you consider risk factors for mental illnesses such as socioeconomic deprivation and extreme weather conditions, it means that the burden of mental illnesses is likely to be higher in other parts of the country where research has not been done,\" Bitta said. She gave examples of these as very arid areas or where there is constant flooding. \"So in summary, the numbers are likely to be higher than three million.\" We have not seen any data to prove or disprove the claim that three million Kenyans have mental health challenges, while an expert said the number is likely understated. However, due to the widely noted unavailability of mental health data, we rate this claim as unproven. \u2014Tess Wandia Ruth Mutua PAYE, or \"pay as you earn\", is an income tax deducted from salaries. Mutua said her party would cut this tax by 50%. She then cited figures from the Kenya Revenue Authority .

        "doc": "President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address was delayed for more than an hour as members of opposition parties introduced various points of order. The chief spokesman of the Economic Freedom Fighters , Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, added two. Here we verify the accuracy of claims he made during the course of it. Claim The two men dressed in blue uniforms stationed inside the doors of the national assembly \"must leave the house. They don't belong here.\" Verdict incorrect Pointing to two men dressed in blue uniforms stationed inside the doors of the national assembly, Ndlozi told the joint sitting of parliament that \"those two people there at the door must leave the house. They don't belong here. Even the justices are seated over there.\" Darren Olivier, senior correspondent for the African Defence Review , told Africa Check via email that the \"two South African air force colonels\" next to the doors were the \"president's aides-de-camp, and traditionally they have always been allowed inside parliament. Photos from previous SONAs show them in the same location, with last year's aides-de-camp being from the South African army.\" Oliver says this is \"one of the traditional norms and protocols inherited with our system. For instance, in other commonwealth countries, such as Australia, the head of state is almost always accompanied by either one or two military aides-de-camp into the houses of parliament. \"In general, aides-de-camp in most countries, including South Africa, wear gold ropes, the aiguillette, from one of their shoulders and are unarmed except for ceremonial swords or daggers where those are still used. In other words, [their presence is] not unusual and a common feature of parliamentary traditions.\" These screenshots show aides-de-camp in attendance at previous State of the Nation addresses. Olivier said he was not sure whether the presence of the aides, as well as other ceremonial military presences within the parliamentary precinct, was \"codified in law or a specific protocol\", but that he would update Africa Check with this information. Africa Check is still attempting to contact the national defence force for comment. We will update this report once we receive a response. - Nechama Brodie Claim \"We are not allowed, according to the constitution, to stand for any office if we have a criminal record.\" Verdict mostly-correct Just before calling Zuma a \"constitutional delinquent\", Ndlozi said that South African citizens are \"not allowed, according to the constitution, to stand for any office if we have a criminal record\" - whether it is parliament, a provincial legislature or local council. Section 47 of South Africa's constitution stipulates the rules regarding who can hold office. This section states that anyone who is qualified to vote for the national assembly - that is, South African citizens 18 years or older - can be a member of the assembly. Additionally, it states that \"unrehabilitated insolvents\" and \"anyone declared of unsound mind by a court of the republic\" cannot stand for office. The provision also excludes anyone who was convicted of an offence and sentenced to more than 12 months' imprisonment without the option of a fine, either in South Africa or outside of it - if the offence would have been a criminal one in South Africa. But when the conviction is being appealed, or the appeal is being decided on, this disqualification does not apply. Finally, the disqualification only applies for five years. Five years after someone has served a prison sentence, the person again qualifies to hold elected office. The separate requirements to hold office in the provincial legislature and municipal councils were explained to Africa Check by the chief communications officer of the Electoral Commission of South Africa , Kate Baphela. She said that the requirements to be elected to a provincial legislature are the same as those for the national assembly. For municipal councils, every citizen who is qualified to vote for a municipal council is allowed to be a member of the council. However, this excludes anyone appointed and paid by a municipality, another office of the state to provide a service or anyone who is disqualified from voting in the national assembly for the reasons given before. - Vinayak Bhardwaj Additional reading https://africacheck.org/reports/facts-alternative-facts-zumas-10th-state-nation-address-checked/",

        "doc": "The national newspaper was mostly correct in its depiction of what it termed the \"dire\" state of education in Nigeria, including the \"paltry\" percentage of the federal budget allocated to education. The paper also accurately reported that only around 61% of Nigerian children who should be in primary school regularly attend and as few as 35% of three-to-five-year-olds receive any formal early childhood education. But the newspaper was wildly off the mark when it reported the trillions of naira allocated to education from 2016 to 2021 \u2013 N55.3 trillion compared to the actual number of N3.7 trillion. To mark this year's International Day of Education , Nigeria's Business Day newspaper turned the spotlight on learning in the country. In a largely scathing February 2022 editorial, the publication, which circulates in Nigeria and Ghana, made several claims , including about funding, attendances and the number of out-of-school children. We checked six of the claims. The newspaper claimed that from 2016 to 2021, it was \"reported\" that Nigeria's government allocated N55.3 trillion to the education sector. We sent an email to Business Day asking for the source of their data and to clarify some of the claims. We will update this report with their response. Documents from the Budget Office of the Federation , however, show far less than this amount was set aside for education in this period. The figures cover statutory transfers under the country's universal basic education (UBE) programme , in addition to recurrent and capital expenditure allocations by the education ministry and its affiliated agencies. The first nine years of education in Nigeria are free and compulsory and are funded under the basic education programme. The table below shows the funding budgeted for the six years under review.  The total allocation to education in the six years added up to N3.70 trillion, a fraction of what the paper claimed. The paper's N55.3 trillion figure is actually closer to the country's total budget for the six years, which was N56.92 trillion. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. Business Day went on to say that less than 10% of the N55.3 trillion it claimed had been budgeted for education was eventually spent on the sector. It gave this figure as N3.5 trillion, suggesting a gulf between what was budgeted and what was eventually released. Budget implementation documents for the years of interest suggest otherwise. They show that for each of the years from 2016 to 2021, 100% of the amounts earmarked for the UBE programme were released. The share of the capital budget released also exceeded 50% in all the years, rising to more than 100% in 2020. The percentage of the education budget released to the sector was significantly more than 10%. The editorial said the education sector's share of Nigeria's 2022 budget was 7.2%. This works out to N1.23 trillion, of a total of N17.13 trillion. It said that an international agreement in 2021 committed countries to spend at least 15% of public funds on education. The available data shows that the budgetary allocation to education in 2022 is in fact slightly lower. The 2022 appropriation act published by the Budget Office of the Federation shows that N593.47 billion was allocated to the education ministry and its agencies for recurrent expenditure, and N159.66 billion for capital projects. N112.29 billion was also earmarked for basic education and N306 billion to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund . This adds up to N1.17 trillion, or 6.83% of the total budget. However, finance minister Zainab Ahmed's public presentation of the approved 2022 budget had the total allocation to education as N1.23 trillion, which is 7.2% of the total budget \u2013 what the paper claimed. The disparity was because the budget presentation document gave a total of N815.69 billion while the figures in the appropriation act added up to N753.13 billion. But the paper's overall argument of low funding holds, as analysts told Africa Check. Inadequate funding severely affects teacher morale The continuously poor funding of education has \"grave implications\" for the country, according to Comfort Edemenang. He is professor of educational administration and planning at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University in Bauchi, northeastern Nigeria. He gave universities as an example. \"Sometimes there is no power or water supply for several days. There is poor infrastructure and both lecturers and students are demoralised. Many want to go abroad.\" Nigeria's education indices from primary to tertiary level are poor, Sidiqat Ijaiya, professor of education management at the University of Ilorin in northern central Nigeria, told Africa Check. He also linked this to the inadequate funding of education. \"A major impact is poor infrastructure. Due to the lack of basic laboratory equipment, we do alternatives to practicals in secondary schools. There is also a lack of equipment in universities.\" Lecturers struggled to remain motivated and often downed tools, Ijaiya said. In February 2022 lecturers went on strike, with better funding of universities one of their demands. \"It's not just about increasing lecturers' pay, it's about infrastructure and teaching aids,\" Ijaiya said. We traced this claim to a November 2021 press release by the Nigeria office of the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). But the statement didn't include the number of schoolchildren killed in the 25 attacks. We found a death toll of 16 in an earlier Unicef press release , dated 16 September 2021. \"So far this year, there have been 20 attacks on schools in Nigeria, with 1,436 children abducted and 16 children dead. More than 200 children are still missing,\" it said . The numbers were from geopolitical intelligence firm SBM Intelligence , said Folashade Adebayo, a spokesperson for Unicef Nigeria. \"In their methodology, they utilise a dual approach. Firstly, they work within a research network that collates information on school attacks in the course of tracking electoral violence and other indicators. Then whatever report is collected is independently verified. Only verified information is reported,\" Adebayo said in an email. She said \"17 learners were reported to have lost their lives in 2021\" and there was a possibility some attacks went unreported. A December 2021 report by human rights organisation Amnesty International described some of the attacks on schools and schoolchildren in Nigeria in 2021. The report stated that over 780 were abducted for ransom in 2021 and over 61 were still in captivity months after their abduction. It however provided no death toll. But there's little doubt insecurity is a challenge to learning. Various sources give estimates of the country's primary school net attendance ratio. This is the percentage of the school-age population that attends primary or secondary school. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2016-2017 showed that 60.9% of children of primary-school age in Nigeria were attending school. The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2018 put the primary school net attendance ratio at 61% . It was 59% for girls and 62% for boys. This survey sampled children between ages six and 12. (Note: The country's official primary school age is six to 11 and older .) The Nigeria Living Standard Survey 2018-2019 , which was conducted between September 2018 and October 2019, found the primary school net attendance ratio was 65.8% . Over 22,000 households were surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics with the support of the World Bank . On this score, the newspaper was correct based on the most recent nationally representative data on access to early childhood education. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2016-2017 showed that 35.6% of children between ages 36 and 59 months attended an early childhood education programme. (This is children between the ages of three and five years.) This indicator varied widely across states in Nigeria. It was as high as 97.1% in Ekiti (South-West) and 94.7% in Enugu (South-East) and as low as 4.4% in Yobe (North-East) and 4.6% in Sokoto (South-West).  Neither the Nigeria Living Standard Survey 2018-2019 nor the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2018 had data on access to early childhood education. Folasade Sulaiman is a professor of early childhood education at the Tai Solarin University of Education , in Ijagun, southwestern Nigeria. She said the percentage may not have increased since 2017. \"A lot of parents are still not convinced they need to put their three-year-olds in preschool. It became worse with the attacks on schools, especially since 2019. Some of the schools are shut in the north, and in some cases, parents have withdrawn their children from school because it's no longer safe. More public awareness on the importance of early schooling was required, she said. Some previously checked claims The newspaper also repeated claims relating to the rate and number of out-of-school children in Nigeria, which we have covered in previous fact-checks . The most far-reaching of the claims, that \"about 10.5 million of the country's children aged 5 to 14 years are not in school\", is neither recent nor correct .",

        "doc": "We re-examined eight claims from four state of the nation addresses. Sona 2016 and 2017 were by president Jacob Zuma, and Sona 2018 and 2019 by president Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma's claims about training for water conservation, and the number of men and women in senior management positions, were correct. Claims on load shedding and housing delivery were incorrect. Ramaphosa's claims about higher education enrolment and social grants were correct. A claim about early childhood education was incorrect, and another on safe toilets in schools unproven. On 13 February 2020, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his fourth state of the nation address. The theme for this year's speech is \"Following up on our commitments: making your future work better.\" The president is expected to update South Africans on the government's progress and outline plans for the next financial year. Africa Check has been fact-checking state of the nation addresses for over six years. If Ramaphosa's track record is anything to go by, we can expect mainly accurate statements on Thursday evening. (He didn't get much factually incorrect in his 2019 address .) Ramaphosa's predecessor, Jacob Zuma, had a harder time staying on the right side of the facts. When he was president of South Africa from 2009 to 2018, he was no stranger to our \"incorrect\" verdict . In this report we review key claims made in the last four state of the nation addresses and give updates on each, according to the most recent statistics. 'Let us work together to turn the situation around. It can be done.' \u2013 Jacob Zuma, Sona 2016 In February 2016 Zuma delivered his ninth state of the nation address . Africa Check looked at seven claims made on the night. One was correct, four mostly correct, and two were incorrect. Claim \"To curb water wastage, the Department of Water and Sanitation has begun its programme of training 15,000 young people as artisans.\" Verdict correct The department of water and sanitation launched their War on Leaks project in August 2015. Its initial aim was to train 15,000 artisans, water agents and plumbers from 2015/16 to 2017/18. They would fix leaking taps and pipes in their communities, helping promote water conservation. Water agents were tasked with educating the public on how to use water wisely and manage water resources. Zuma was correct when he made this statement in 2016. As of 25 January 2016, 2,897 people were being trained, former department spokesperson Mlimandlela Ndamase told Africa Check. They included 1,573 artisans, 243 plumbers and 1,081 water agents. But how have things progressed since then? Phase 1 of the project was meant to be completed in the 2015/16 financial year, after 3,000 artisans, plumbers and water agents were trained. Figures from November 2019 show that 1,726 candidates completed their training. Another 5,000 were meant to be trained in 2016/17, when phase 2 started. But the available data shows that only 3,854 people were trained. Phase 3 was \"put on hold\" due to the department's \"funding challenges\". A commitment to more funding was reportedly made in January 2020. \"As you correctly say, the programme was implemented,\" Prof Mike Muller, former director general of water affairs, told Africa Check. \"However, I am not aware of any claims that it has been successful \u2013 in fact quite the opposite. It has been recognised by government that the programme has failed to meet its goals.\" Claim \"There has been no load shedding since August last year.\" Verdict incorrect Zuma was incorrect when he made this statement in February 2016. According to a media statement by power utility Eskom, there was load shedding on 14 September 2015. South Africa is again experiencing these rotational power outages as Eskom's shortage of capacity continues. The utility says there's a possibility load shedding will remain for the next 18 months. 'Let us unite in driving radical economic transformation for the good of our country.' \u2013 Jacob Zuma, Sona 2017 In 2017, amid unprecedented security measures , Zuma delivered his 10th state of the nation address. It was his last as president of South Africa. Africa Check looked at 20 claims in the speech. Only 12 were correct, with the rest a mixture of mostly correct, misleading, unproven, understated and incorrect. Claim \"At the level of gender, at senior management level males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4%.\" Verdict correct The commission for employment equity's 2015/16 annual report showed that 67.6% of employees at senior management were men and 32.4% were women. Three years later, the situation remains much the same. The commission's 2018/19 annual report showed that 65.5% of employees at senior management were men and 34.5% were women. Claim \"Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than 4 million houses since 1994.\" Verdict incorrect Data from the department of human settlements shows Zuma was incorrect when he made this statement. A total of 3,030,824 housing units were delivered from 1994/1995 to 2015/16 \u2013 around a million less than Zuma claimed. It is possible that Zuma was referring to the delivery of both houses and serviced sites. But a serviced site is not a house. It is a piece of land supplied with water, electricity and sanitation, on which a recipient can build their own house. When serviced sites were added to Zuma's figure, the number of \"housing opportunities\" rose to 4,060,795 How many more houses has the government provided since then? A total of 90,692 houses were built in the 2016/17 financial year, 86,048 in 2017/18 and 77,584 in 2018/19. This brings the total number of houses provided by the government to 3,285,148. The total number of housing opportunities stands at 4.7 million . But there are concerns about the accuracy of housing statistics. Experts caution that the figures have not been independently verified, so they should be seen as \" indicative rather than entirely conclusive \". 'Now is the time for all of us to work together.' \u2013 Cyril Ramaphosa, Sona 2018 South Africa's 2018 state of the nation address was postponed for more than a week as the presidency changed hands from Jacob Zuma to Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa's maiden address touched on education, employment and poverty, among other issues. Of the 12 claims Africa Check looked at, 10 were correct and two incorrect. Claim \"There are currently almost one million students who are enrolled in higher education, up from 500,000 in 1994.\" Verdict correct In 1994, there were 525,000 students enrolled in South Africa's higher education institutions. These included historically black universities and technikons, historically white universities and technikons, and distance-learning institutions. Audited data shows that by 2015, enrolment had grown to 985,212 students at 26 public higher education institutions. Ramaphosa's claim was therefore correct. Since then the figure has grown to more than a million. In 2017, 1,036,984 students were enrolled in 26 public higher education institutions. Claim \"Today we have nearly 1 million children who are participating in early childhood development facilities.\" Verdict incorrect Africa Check previously rated this claim as \"correct\" based on information from the department of basic education . But research suggests that Ramaphosa's figure of \"nearly 1 million children\" is a significant underestimate. Martin Gustafsson , an economics researcher at the University of Stellenbosch , said there were \" widespread misperceptions around how many children in South Africa attend some form of ECD institution\". He has researched and written extensively on the economics of education and pre-school participation . Gustafsson used data from Statistics South Africa's 2016 mid-year population estimates and 2016 Community Survey to estimate the number of children in any type of pre-school in 2016. His calculations put the figure at 2,409,953 children. But he did add that this could be an over or underestimation. Gustafsson was not aware of any updated figures. But if early childhood development participation is higher than what is believed, what are the implications? \"We have to worry less about expanding access and more about improving the quality of what already exists,\" Gustafsson said. 'The task before us is formidable.' \u2013 Cyril Ramaphosa, Sona 2019 Ramaphosa delivered his second state of the nation address in parliament on 7 February 2019. It was also the fifth and final address of the previous administration before the national election in May 2019. Of the 12 claims Africa Check fact-checked, eight were correct and the rest a mixture of mostly correct, unproven and understated. Claim \"Every month 17.5 million social grants are provided to South Africans.\" Verdict correct The South African Social Security Agency administers social grants. Its most recent data on grants at the time was from December 2018, when 17,731,402 social grants were paid. The average for the 2017/18 financial year ending in March 2018 was 17,509,555 grants. Ramaphosa's claim was therefore correct. The most recent data from the 2018/19 financial year shows that the number of social grants provided by the government increased to 17,811,745 . Claim \"Since we launched the [Safe] initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects and a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages.\" Verdict unproven The Sanitation Appropriate for Education \u2013 Safe \u2013 initiative, launched in August 2018, is a government programme that aims to replace all pit latrines and other unacceptable toilet facilities at public schools. At the time the department of basic education told Africa Check that the president's figures were from December 2018. Spokesperson Troy Martens said upgrades had been completed at another 88 schools, bringing the total to 787 in 2019. But it was difficult to independently verify the department's numbers. The claim was rated as unproven. In October 2019, the department gave an update on the progress so far. Records from a committee meeting note that when the Safe initiative was launched and a desktop audit conducted, 3,898 schools were identified as needing attention. For the 2019/20 financial year, there are 1,007 projects: 880 in the planning stage and 127 under construction. The number of completed projects stands at 188. This would bring the total number of completed projects to 975. However, as with the initial claim, it is difficult to verify the figure. A new approach to fact-checking Sona Africa Check is taking a different approach to the state of the nation address this year. Rather than fact-checking all the claims made on the night, we'll conduct a deeper analysis of any claims president Ramaphosa gets wrong. We're not trying to catch him out - we're interested in why the facts were misunderstood and the implications of getting them wrong. Stay tuned! Additional research by Taryn Willows",

        "doc": "South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) is adamant that despite criticism of corruption, crime, poverty and inequality, it has a \"good story to tell\" voters ahead of general elections in May 2014. The party dominates the national government and holds a majority in all but one of South Africa's nine provinces. \"Twenty years ago we began a journey to eradicate the legacy of apartheid,\" President Jacob Zuma wrote in the introduction to the ANC's 2014 election manifesto . \"The lives of our people have vastly improved and South Africa is a much better place than it was before 1994\u2026\" So how has the ANC fared and does its \"good story\" stand up to scrutiny? In this - the first of two reports - we evaluate some of the key claims that the ANC has made in its campaign to win over voters ahead of the country's general election on 7 May. Claim \"In 1994, 1.2-million families were without homes. In 2013, more than 3.3-million families have free homes.\" Verdict incorrect The comparison is flawed. In 1994, the Housing White Paper estimated that there was an urban housing backlog of 1.5-million houses, not 1.2-million. Two years later, in 1996, the national census revealed that 1,400,000 shacks or informal dwellings remained in the country. This represented 16% of the nearly 9-million households in South Africa at the time. The 2011 national census found that the number of informal dwellings or shacks had increased to just over 1.9-million. This represented 13% of all households in South Africa; a decrease of 3 percentage points since 1996. Data compiled by the Department of Human Settlements shows that almost 2.8-million \"housing units\" and 876,774 \"serviced sites\" were completed between 1994 and December 2013. This is a total of nearly 3.7-million \"housing opportunities\". The ANC claims that 3.3-million families have free homes. But the real picture is far more complex. By definition, \"housing opportunities\" created by the department are not all free and increasingly involve the provision of \"serviced sites\", not houses. For instance, the 2.8-million \"housing units\" include not only houses, but also \"affordable rental housing units\" and \"housing units\" which are subsidised by the state. A recent Africa Check report highlighted the fact that the number of houses being delivered by government has fallen significantly in six of South Africa's nine provinces since 2009. Part of the reason for this is that provincial governments are providing \"serviced sites\" \u2013 essentially pieces of land connected to water, electricity and sewerage infrastructure and services - rather than houses. Recipients of serviced sites are expected to build their own houses at their own cost or with the assistance of a subsidy. Editor's note: The true extent of South Africa's current housing backlog remains unclear. Over the past two months, Africa Check has made repeated requests to the Department of Human Settlements for its data on housing backlogs. Again and again we have been told that the data has been \"compiled for consideration by principals\" and will be sent to us after it has been reviewed. To date we have not received it and can only assume that the department is deliberately stalling the release of the information. We will continue to pursue the matter. Claim \"In 1994, 5.5-million households had access to electricity.\" Verdict incorrect According to data compiled by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency as part of a review of government performance over the past twenty years, 4,477,400 households had access to electricity in 1994/95. This was 50.9% of the country's 8,802,000 households. Claim \"In 2013, more than 11-million households have access to electricity.\" Verdict correct According to Statistics South Africa's 2012 General Household Survey ,  85.3% of South Africa's 14,631,000 households were connected to mains electricity. This equals 12,480,243 households. Claim \"In 1994, only 2.6-million grants were awarded to a select few.\" Verdict correct This claim is correct, according to data from the Department of Social Development which shows that there were 2,628,458 social grant recipients in 1994. Claim \"In 2013, more than 16-million South Africans receive social grants.\" Verdict misleading This claim relies on cherry-picked numbers. Data from the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) shows that 16-million social grants were indeed awarded in each of the first seven months of 2013 . What the claim ignores is that between August and December 2013 , the number of social grants awarded sharply decreased to less than 16-million a month. The reason, according to SASSA spokesman Kgomoco Diseko, was a re-registration programme which identified large numbers of fraudulent and dead grant recipients. These \"ghost\" beneficiaries were removed from the system. The latest data available from SASSA shows that 15,821,946 social grants were awarded in February 2014. Claim \"The economy regained the 1-million jobs lost as the results of the 2008 global recession. Employment is now higher than it has ever been.\" Verdict misleading It is difficult to evaluate how many jobs were lost as a direct result of the recession. Data compiled by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) shows that more than 800,000 jobs were shed between the end of 2008 and the third quarter of 2010. According to Stats SA's Quarterly Labour Force Survey, 13,844,000 people were employed in the fourth quarter of 2008. By the third quarter of 2010, that figure had fallen dramatically to 12,975,000 \u2013 a loss of 869,000 jobs. By the end of 2013 , employment figures had increased to 15,177,000. What the claim doesn't acknowledge is that the unemployment rate in South Africa is higher today than it was before the recession. In 2008, 3,8-million people were classified as unemployed, resulting in a \"narrow unemployment rate\" of 21.9% . (It is important to note that the \"narrow unemployment rate\" refers only to people who are unemployed and actively seeking work .) At the end of 2013, 4,8-million people were unemployed , according to Stats SA, and the country's narrow unemployment rate was 24.1%. Claim \"Nearly 80,000 land claims, totalling 3.4 million hectares, have been settled. 1.8 million people have benefited.\" Verdict mostly-correct The claim appears to be largely correct. A total of 67,531 land claims had been submitted by the cut-off date of 31 March 1999. A backlog in processing saw this number grow to a total of 79,696 claims. By the end of 2012 nearly 96% of these claims had reportedly been settled. The 2012/2013 annual report of the Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights states: \"A total of 77,334 claims have been settled to date. Of these, 71,292 claims were settled by payment of financial compensation of R6,561,021,691 to claimants.\" The report stated that this was in the form of 3 million hectares of land. The annual report also indicates that a \"total of 111,278 people benefitted from the restitution programme in the 2012/13 financial year\". An earlier Progress Report on Land Restitution Claims delivered to the Portfolio Committee On Rural Development and Land Reform in February 2012 indicated that, between 1995 and January 2012, a total of 76,506 claims had been settled which impacted on 1,662,099 beneficiaries. When the 2012/13 figure of 111,278 is added to this, it results in a total of 1,773,377 individuals. Claim \"In 1994, 10% of our communities had access to safe water.\" Verdict incorrect The 2012 Development Indicators compiled by the Department of Performance Monitoring in the Presidency reported that in 1994/95 61.9% of households had access to water infrastructure that was \"greater than or equal to [Reconstruction and Development Programme] standards\". This standard is, in part, equal to a minimum of 25 litres of potable water per person per day within 200 metres of a household. Claim In 2013, more than 92% of our communities have access to safe water.\" Verdict unproven The claim is not supported by available research. The 2011 census , found that 91.2% of households had access to piped water, either inside their own homes or yards or from communal taps. The remaining households, 8.8% (or about 4.5-million people), had no access to piped water. The latest General Household Survey put the percentage of households with access to piped or tap water at 90.8%. However, as a previous Africa Check report has shown, access to water does not always mean that the water-related services are good or that the water is safe. The 2012 General Household Survey found that only 60.1% of households rated the quality of water-related services they received as \"good\", down from 76.4% in 2005. Claim \"More than 1,500 healthcare facilities have been built and hundreds more are being revamped.\" Verdict unproven Africa Check has been unable to verify the accuracy of the claim. The ANC told Africa Check that the claim referred to the period 1994 to 2013. A document they provided to us stated that between 1994 and July 2001, 532 hospitals and 123 health facilities were built. A further 252 clinics were upgraded and 53 health facilities were upgraded and replaced. The party claims that between 2002 and 2013 a further 530 health facilities were built. On 17 April, the ANC offered to provide Africa Check with a complete list of healthcare facilities that were built or upgraded. We will update this report if we receive it.

        "doc": "Ruto's manifesto gets it right when it comes to the decline in manufacturing's contribution to the Kenyan GDP, how the country's foreign debt is made up, and a couple of other important economic indicators. But it was off, sometimes wildly, in how much food imports have increased over the past decade, and that edible oils are the country's second-largest import after petrol. The campaign's claim about how much agricultural land in Kenya requires irrigation could also not be proven. Kenyan deputy president William Ruto hopes to go one better after elections in August 2022 and become president. In June, his campaign published his manifesto . Ruto is on the ticket of the United Democratic Alliance party. The manifesto promised to create more decent jobs for the millions in the informal economy , lower the cost of living, as well as employ 116,000 teachers in two years. Ruto also pledged, among others, affordable loans for small businesses, investment in agriculture, affordable housing, universal healthcare and to \"end state capture\". We did not assess the viability of his campaign promises as we cannot fact-check the future. But we did sift through the evidence to find out if the manifesto cited the most accurate data on some key claims. The manifesto called for an \"inclusive\" economy. It claimed that the majority of Kenyans work in the informal economy. The national statistics office collects data on employment and publishes this in its flagship annual economic survey. The most recent survey shows that in 2020, 2.74 million people, or 15.8%, were employed in the formal sector, and 14.5 million in the informal sector. In 2021, a provisional estimate said those employed in the formal sector were 2.9 million or 15.9%, and those in the informal sector were 15.3 million. We rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The manifesto said a rise in interest rates had made it difficult to manage foreign commercial debt. Foreign debt is the total public and private debt that a country owes foreign creditors, experts have previously told Africa Check. It includes bilateral debt, multilateral debt and commercial debt. Multilateral debt is owed to international financial institutions such as the African Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Commercial debt is owed to commercial enterprises or banks. John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer with the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership , a global budget transparency organisation, told Africa Check that the best source for this data was the national treasury . He directed us to the quarterly economic and budgetary review , published in February 2022, which includes data until the end of December 2021. This showed total foreign debt was KSh4.2 trillion or US$37.1 billion. Of this, foreign commercial debt was Ksh 1.21 trillion or $10.7 billion. ( Note: The exchange rate at the end of December 2021 was KSh113.14 for every US dollar) Foreign commercial debt worked out to 28.9% of all of Kenya's external debt. We rate this claim as correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma The rise in the food import bill had increased the country's vulnerability to global food supply shocks, the manifesto said . For data on Kenya's imports, Benjamin Muchiri, a senior manager at the national statistics office, directed us to the annual economic survey . The full decade for which we have data is 2010 to 2020, while we also have provisional data for 2011 to 2021. Food imports as a percentage of all goods imported (2010-2021) Year Share Amount (KSh billions) Amount (US$ million) 2010 7.4% 70.4 888.6 2011 8.2% 106 1,193.2 2012 7.9% 109.1 1,290 2019 10.3% 186.8 1831.6 2020 10.7% 176.3 1,655.9 2021* 9.9% 212.8 1,940.7 * provisional. Sources: Annual economic survey 2015 & 2022 for food imports, and for previous and recent exchange rates . As a share of all goods imported, food and beverages rose from 7.4% to 10.7% between 2010 and 2020, an increase of three percentage points, or from 8.2% to 9.9% between 2011 and 2021 \u2013 1.7 percentage points. In actual terms, in US dollars, the amount increased from $888.6 million in 2010 to $1.66 billion in 2020, a two-fold increase, or from $1.2 billion in 2011 to $1.9 billion in 2021, a 60% increase. The only way to get to a 2.5-fold increase as claimed in the manifesto is to use the Kenyan shilling. In the local currency, the amount increased from KSh70.4 billion in 2010 to KSh176.3 billion in 2020. But the claim references dollars, and the maths doesn't add up. The manifesto was wrong on the share of food as a percentage of all imports, and also mangled numbers while calculating the bill. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's data agency publishes data on imports every year. The most recent data showed the top three imports over the last three years are petroleum products, industrial machinery, and iron and steel. Animal and vegetable fats were fourth. Value of top four Kenyan imports (KSh billion) Import 2019 2020 2021 Petroleum products 307.5 201.1 335.3 Industrial machinery 257.6 231.9 254.8 Iron and steel 104.1 105.1 155.5 Animal/vegetable oil 59.9 94.1 120.8 Source: Economic survey 2022 In 2020, Kenya imported 893 tonnes of palm oil valued at $671 million (KSh73.6 billion). We haven't seen data for 2021 yet, but it is unlikely to be significantly different from the three-year trend of imports. We rate this claim as incorrect. \u2013 Dancan Bwire \"Irrigation is the single most important game changer in agriculture,\" Ruto's manifesto said . It then noted that \"two-thirds of Kenya's agricultural land required irrigation\". The Food and Agriculture Organization defines agricultural land as \"land used for cultivation of crops and animal husbandry\". Put another way, it is \"the total of areas under 'cropland' and 'permanent meadows and pastures'\". Kenya's agricultural land amounts to 27.6 million hectares. In its master plan, the country's water services regulator aims to irrigate 1.2 million hectares, with 623,700 hectares irrigated by 2030. The national irrigation policy gave the country's irrigation potential as 1.3 million hectares in 2015. We know how much agricultural land there is. We also know how much land can be sustainably irrigated given the data on potential land. However, we don't know how much agricultural land is in arid and semi-arid areas, which requires irrigation, but cannot be irrigated due to scarcity of water resources, cost and other factors mentioned in the Kenya agriculture strategy . Without that data, we cannot prove or disprove this claim. We therefore rate it unproven. \u2013 Dancan Bwire For data on airline passenger traffic, we checked with the International Civil Aviation Authority , the United Nations special agency for air transport. The data showed in 2019, Africa accounted for 2.1% of the global air passenger traffic. Africa Check also checked these numbers with Raffaella Irie, the manager in charge of data and statistics at the African Airlines Association . Irie shared with us the association's 2021 annual report . \"The continent has the weakest contribution to the global air traffic: the share of African airlines traffic reduced from 2.11% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020,\" the report noted . We therefore rate this claim correct. \u2013 Tess Wandia The national statistics bureau said the manufacturing sector contributed 9.3% to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. GDP is the total market value of goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. The most recent economic survey shows the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP fell to 7.6% in 2020. That year's annual economic survey put the decrease down to the disruptions caused by Covid-19 pandemic. We rate this claim as correct. \u2013 Dancan Bwire",

        "doc": "In a race to the wire, Johnson Sakaja and Polycarp Igathe are slugging it out on the campaign trail as they go for the prized Nairobi governor's seat. In a nationally televised debate on 11 July, they sold their agenda to Nairobians. Igathe fumbled some of his numbers on revenues, but was on firmer footing with other numbers such as on voting. Sakaja has an impressive record as senator but still inflated his achievements. However, he got his funding numbers right. With the clock ticking down to the 9 August elections, Kenyan media organised a debate for candidates hoping to be the governor of Nairobi county. Pollsters have Johnson Sakaja , who represents the county in the senate, and Polycarp Igathe , a former deputy governor, as the frontrunners . Sakaja is running on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket, while Igathe is the Jubilee Party candidate. In a debate that was often bare-knuckled , the pair sparred about their respective visions for the Kenyan capital. But when the dust settled, how did they fare with their facts? We looked at 10 of their claims. We have contacted the offices of both candidates for the source of their data. We'll update this report when we hear back. Polycarp Igathe - Jubilee party Kenya's 47 county governments get funding from the national government through monthly payouts by the national treasury . The money is shared equitably across the counties, and also in the form of conditional grants meant for a specific purpose. \"Mwaka uliopita, taifa la Kenya\u2026 pesa ambazo walituma kwa serikali gatuzi kutoka kwa serikali ya kitaifa was KSh370 billion,\"Igathe said , speaking in Kiswahili. This translates to: \"Last year the national government sent KSh370 billion to the county governments.\" The most recent financial year - 2021/22 - ended on 30 June. But data for this has not been released. However, the national treasury said that as of 31 May 2022, it had sent KSh286.5 billion to counties. This data, published on 17 June, showed counties were due KSh409.9 billion, being KSh370 billion as equitable share and KSh39.9 billion in conditional grants. The last full financial year for which there's data is 2020/21. This showed treasury disbursed KSh346.2 billion to the counties as equitable share. These numbers are also corroborated by reports from the controller of budget . The treasury added KSh52.8 billion to this amount, bringing the total sent to counties to KSh399 billion. We have not seen any figures that back Igathe's claim that in the last financial year the national government sent KSh370 billion to counties. He appeared to have confused allocations with actual transfers. He also left out conditional grants, leaving him to work off an inaccurate base. \u2013 Makinia Juma Igathe claimed that Nairobi got 5% of the money disbursed to counties. The most recent data from the treasury was published on 17 June. This showed that of the KSh286.5 billion sent to the counties so far, Nairobi got KSh14.3 billion. This works out to 5%. The data covers the period from 1 July 2021 to 31 May 2022. Until this point, Igathe is on the money. He also mentioned \"KSh370 billion\", which is the equitable share allocated to counties in the 2021/22 financial year. Using the figure, the data showed Nairobi was allocated KSh19.3 billion. The  city was also allocated KSh1.02 billion of the total KSh39.9 billion in conditional grants. The total allocation to Nairobi (KSh20.3 billion) as a share of the total allocations to counties (KSh409.9 billion) works to 5%. \u2013 Makinia Juma Igathe argued that the capital deserves a bigger share of the national revenues in keeping with voter numbers. \"Wapiga kura Nairobi ni 11%,\" he said in Kiswahili. This translates to \"Nairobi has 11% of the voters\". He added that Nairobi had 2.4 million of the country's 22 million voters. Kenya's electoral commission has data on registered voters. The most recent, released on 20 June 2022, shows the country had 22,102,532 voters in all the 47 counties. When registered voters in prisons and those living abroad are factored in, the number increases slightly to 22,120,458. Nairobi county has 2,415,310 registered voters. As a percentage of all the registered Kenyan voters, with or without those in prisons and the diaspora, this works out to 10.9% . Igathe was on the mark. \u2013 Tess Wandia \"KSh2.2 trillion wamecollect Kenya Revenue Authority. 60% ya hiyo KSh2.2 trillion imetoka kwa viwanda na wafanyabiashara hapa Nairobi,\" said Igathe, in Kiswahili. This translates to: \"The Kenya Revenue Authority has collected KSh2.2 trillion, 60% of that has come from the businesses and industries in Nairobi.\" On 7 July 2022 the tax agency announced it had collected a record KSh2.03 trillion in taxes in the 2021/22 financial year. ( Note: Igathe exaggerated this figure by KSh200 billion .) But does 60% of this revenue come from Nairobi businesses and industries? \"We have never come across a geographical spread to tax collection,\" John Kinuthia told Africa Check. He is a senior programmes officer at the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership , a budget transparency think tank. \"Igathe might have gone back to the old assumption about Nairobi contributing 60% of the GDP, which is also incorrect,\" Kinuthia said. In April, Igathe incorrectly said the Kenyan capital contributed 40% to the country's gross domestic product. It is a resilient but inaccurate statistic, as we found in previous fact-checks in 2019 and 2021 , and which Kenyan pundits continue to unfortunately rely on . The most recent data showed Nairobi contributed 27.5% to Kenya's GDP. We have not seen any data showing how much taxes the revenue authority collects from the various counties in Kenya. Because we have no data to prove or disprove the claim, we rate it unproven.  \u2013 Makinia Juma. Johnson Sakaja - UDA party \" If you look at the studies that have been done for the last three year running, I have been rated the best performing senator in the republic of Kenya,\" said Sakaja. Kenyan non-profit Mzalendo monitors the Kenyan parliament and publishes annual rankings of the performance of Kenyan legislators. \"Our scorecard is normally made on the basis of the contribution they make to the house. We also have a separate ranking, the one we call Shujaaz awards. This goes to specific issues that they raised,\" Caroline Gaita, Mzalendo's  executive director told Africa Check. The People's Shujaaz awards recognise parliamentarians who champion public interest issues in the debating chamber. So is Sakaja the star of the Kenyan senate? \"We've ranked him from 2018, 2019 and 2020 and he was among the best performing senators,\" said Gaita. \"Sakaja was a Shujaaz awards recipient in 2018. He ranked highly in almost all our scorecards. His committee was also one of the best\". Gaita sent us the 2018 , 2019 and 2020 annual parliamentary scorecard reports. The 2021 report is yet to be published, she said. The 2018 report ranks Sakaja as the top senator.  In 2019 , Mzalendo ranked Ledama Olekina of Narok county as the best performing senator and Sakaja as the best performing youth in the senate. In 2020 , Sakaja emerged the top male senator and the top male youth senator. There certainly is a ranking of Kenyan senators, and for three consecutive years Sakaja came out on top.  \u2013 Dancan Bwire A bill is a draft law. The senate legislates on bills affecting counties. Kenya's senate has 47 elected senators, each representing a county. Sakaja was elected in 2017 to represent Nairobi city county . Sakaja claimed he had brought more bills than any other senator and invited debate moderators to check the numbers. For a record of his performance, we contacted the senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye. He referred us to data on the senate website. The data showed Sakaja sponsored one bill, the Start-up bill 2020 . He co-sponsored two others, the first with Mutula Kilonzo Junior of Makueni county and the other with nominated senator Farhiya Haji . His tally is three. The bills were not specific to Nairobi, but affected all counties. The senator with the highest number of bills is Dr Agnes Zani , nominated by the Orange Democratic Movement party . She has five bills to her name. At least two other senators each have three bills to their name. They are Aaron Cheruiyot of Kericho county and Ledama Olekina of Narok county. Senate data does not back Sakaja's claim that he had the highest number of bills in the chamber. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu A motion is a proposal put forward for debate or decision in a legislative house. The Kenyan senate has data on motions filed from 2017, when Sakaja was elected to the senate, to 16 June 2022. Nominated senator Sylvia Kasanga proposed 15 motions between 2017 and 2022. Dr Abdullahi Ali , the senator for Wajir, was next with 13 motions to his name. Dr Getrude Musuruve sponsored 11 motions over the same period. Sakaja proposed 10 motions. He therefore hasn't brought the highest number of motions to the senate. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenyan senate rules allow any senator to seek a statement from a senate committee on any matter. These statements are framed as questions about specific issues that a senator wants answers on from a ministry or any other government arm. The most recent data shows Sakaja sought 28 statements in the senate since 2018, of which 23 were about Nairobi, while five were about policy issues across the country. The questions ranged from demolitions of houses, health facilities in the capital and the city's water problems to the governance challenges in the county government and the plans to ease congestion on  Nairobi's roads. Sakaja did raise the highest number of questions on Nairobi. Next was nominated senator Millicent Omanga , who sought 22 statements, half of which were about Nairobi \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu The work of a senator, Sakaja said , is to bring resources to the county. When he was elected, the county was receiving KSh15 billion, he claimed. The national treasury releases funds to county governments every month. The controller of budget keeps a record of annual transfers from the national government to each county. In 2016/17, the full financial year before Sakaja's election as senator , Nairobi received KSh14.02 billion in equitable share, and KSh576 million as conditional grants, for a total of KSh14.6 billion. In his first financial year in office, 2017/18, the county got KSh15.4 billion inequitable share and KSh817.4 million as conditional grants, making for a total of KSh16.2 billion. The average across the two years is about KSh15 billion. We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi In the financial year 2020/21, the controller of budget reported that Nairobi county received KSh19.4 billion in equitable share, and KSh254.2 million as conditional grants. They add up to KSh19.7 billion. The most recent treasury data, published on 17 June 2022, shows that Nairobi has so far received KSh14.34 billion of a total allocation of KSh19.4 billion as its equitable share in 2021/22. It was also set to get KSh1.02 billion in conditional grants. The financial year ended on 30 June, but the treasury has yet to release annual data. A rise from KSh16.2 billion received in his first year in office, to KSh19.7 billion in 2020/21, the most recent year for which we have full data, works out to KSh3.5 billion. We therefore rate the claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi",

        "doc": "The Punch article is mostly correct to say a Nigerian woman has a one-in-22 lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy, childbirth, after birth or after an abortion. But its claim that Nigeria's maternal mortality rate is 512 deaths for every 100,000 live births is unproven. And its figure for maternal mortality in developed countries is incorrect. The article is also incorrect to claim that fewer than 60% of pregnant Nigerian women attend antenatal clinics. A recent article in the national Nigerian newspaper Punch has a startling headline: \"Rubbing cow dung on vagina during labour won't aid delivery, can cause infection \u2013Gynaecologist\". The August 2022 article interviews Dr Labaran Aliyu, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in the northern Nigerian state of Kano. Aliyu discusses cultural practices that pose major risks to the health of pregnant women. The article makes some interesting claims. We looked at four. We have asked Aliyu for the evidence for the claims and will update this report with his response. The World Health Organization uses the availability of antenatal care as an indicator of access to healthcare during pregnancy. It says the antenatal period \u2013 conception to birth \u2013 is vital to the health of pregnant women and their infants. The most recent data on antenatal care in Nigeria is from the 2021 multiple indicator cluster survey (Mics) and national immunisation coverage survey (Nics) . It found that 70% of women aged 15 to 49 who had given birth in the five years before the survey received antenatal care from a skilled provider at least once in their most recent pregnancy. The survey, by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), was carried out across Nigeria from September to December 2021. A total of 38,806 women were interviewed.  Older survey yields similar numbers The 2018 Nigeria demographic and health survey (DHS), done every five years, also has national data on antenatal care. It found that 67% of women aged 15 to 49 had received antenatal care from a skilled provider at least once during their most recent pregnancy. It also found that 57% had at least four antenatal care visits. The DHS interviewed 41,821 women from August to December 2018 . The available data does not support the claim that \"less than 60%\" of Nigerian women attend antenatal clinics. The article attributes this stat to the 2018 demographic and health survey . This interviewed 106,590 women, aged 15 to 49 and who had sisters, across the country. They were asked if any of their sisters aged 12 and above had died, and if the death had been pregnancy-related. The study estimated maternal mortality at 512 deaths for every 100,000 live births in the seven years before the survey. This means that for every 1,000 live births in Nigeria in that period, about five women died either during pregnancy, childbirth or within two months after giving birth. But this indicator is not captured in the 2021 Mics survey , the most recent. A former director at the statistics bureau previously told Africa Check that they stopped recording maternal mortality due to persistent issues with sampling. Understanding the different terms for maternal death The World Health Organization defines maternal death as any death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth or up to 42 days after birth, but excludes accidents . A late maternal death is \"the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy\". Late maternal death also includes both direct and indirect maternal and obstetric deaths. Direct maternal death is caused by obstetric complications and from interventions, omissions and incorrect treatment. Other causes include haemorrhage or hypertensive disorders, complications of anaesthesia and caesarean section. Indirect maternal death results from \"previous existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and not due to direct obstetric causes but were aggravated by the physiologic effects of pregnancy\".  We found the source as a 2019 World Health Organization article titled \"Maternal health in Nigeria: generating information for action\". \"A Nigerian woman has a 1 in 22 lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum/post-abortion,\" it says . But this data was dated, Ann-Beth Moller, a technical officer with the WHO's sexual and reproductive health and research department, told Africa Check. \"Please note the website reported old data,\" she said. The article estimates Nigeria's maternal mortality rate as more than 800 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. The most recent data was the trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2017 report, Moller said. The report's estimates are by the WHO, Unicef, the World Bank and other agencies. They put the lifetime risk of maternal death in Nigeria at one in 21 , close to the older WHO estimate and the claim in Punch. For a more recent estimate, we checked the 2018 Nigeria demographic and health survey (NDHS). This indicates that one in 34 women in Nigeria is likely to die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Why is this estimate lower than the WHO's? A statistician at Nigeria's data agency told Africa Check the NDHS estimate was based on the seven-year period preceding the survey and included more indicators. The trends report's estimates, on the other hand, were for 2017 only. There could be many reasons why Nigeria still has a high number of maternal deaths. Moller said women still had relatively low access to antenatal care, delivery by a skilled birth attendant, birth at a health facility, and care after birth. To check this claim, the WHO's Moller again referred us to the maternal mortality: levels and trends 2000 to 2017 estimates. \"We do not have an estimate for developed countries but for high income ones it is one in 5,400,\" she said. The World Bank classifies economies with a gross national income of US$13,205 or more per person as \"high income\". Nigeria is classified as a lower middle income economy, with a GNI per person of $1,086 to $4,255.",

        "doc": "In his 1 October 2021 Independence Day speech, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari made numerous claims about the country's progress under his administration. His correct claims were about petroleum industry reform, economic recovery after the 2020 recession, agriculture's contribution to GDP, and road construction. Claims about Covid vaccine rollout, the surrender of 8,000 Boko Haram terrorists and the national school feeding scheme were mostly correct. One claim about drinking water was understated, and another misleading. But Buhari was incorrect to say that the non-oil sector's contribution to GDP had consistently risen. On 1 October 2021 president Muhammadu Buhari addressed Nigeria on the country's Independence Day . This marked 61 years since Nigeria became a sovereign state after British colonial rule. Buhari reflected on progress but also highlighted recent challenges , including the Covid-19 pandemic, insecurity and an economic dip. \"Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions,\" he said. In this report we check 10 claims about vaccines, the economy, road construction, water, insecurity, school feeding and more. We asked the president's special adviser on media and publicity, and State House, for the source of the claims, but they are yet to respond. Buhari condemned global vaccine inequity and said Nigeria was exploring ways to get safe and effective vaccines for its citizens. These include buying vaccines through international vaccination programmes such as Covax and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust . But have 5 million Nigerians received a Covid-19 vaccine jab? Data from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency , the organisation in charge of giving the vaccines, shows that 1.79 million Nigerians had received the second dose , and were considered fully vaccinated, by 21 September 2021. It also shows that 4.5 million Nigerians had received one vaccine shot . We rate the claim mostly correct. Nigeria has weathered a 12-year running battle with Boko Haram insurgents. More recently, since 2015, this conflict has been mainly confined to the northeastern part of the country. (Note: See our factsheet for more information on the terrorist organisation and its violent insurgency.) In 2015, Buhari ran for the presidency with an election promise that \"no force, external or internal, will occupy even an inch of Nigerian soil\". Despite the gains claimed by Buhari, the group ( which has now splintered ) has carried out coordinated attacks on military formations . It has also taken over entire local councils and collected taxes from residents and farmers. In September 2021, the commander of a military unit said 8,000 insurgents had surrendered to the army. Abdulwahab Eyitayo, an acting general officer commanding, said most of the insurgents who surrendered were the wives and children of terrorists, or had been forcefully recruited . 'Not time to celebrate yet' Taking 8,000 insurgents into custody was at best a temporary gain, security expert Vitus Ukoji told Africa Check. Ukoji is the project coordinator at Nigeria Watch , which monitors lethal violence, conflicts, and human security in the country. He said the number was likely accurate but warned that the terrorist group still posed a threat. \"It's really not time to celebrate because Boko Haram is still recruiting. Poverty and high youth unemployment are drivers. There is also the suspicion that some of the insurgents that surrendered are not genuinely repentant,\" he explained. \"Assimilating them could harm society. It took several years to radicalise these insurgents. It would take a lot more than a six-month programme to deradicalise them.\" Since Nigeria's return to democracy in 1999, successive governments have tried to develop new legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks for the oil and gas industry. In 2000, the Oil and Gas Sector Reform Implementation Committee was created to transform the industry. Four years later it drafted a national oil and gas policy. Parliament approved the policy in 2007. A year later it had morphed into the Petroleum Industry Bill but it was only passed in July 2021. Buhari signed the bill into law in August. It provides the legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the industry and the development of host communities. The law is expected to transform the sector by encouraging investments, stimulating focus on midstream operations, and improving the funding potentials for joint venture oil projects, Adewale Ajayi says in a report analysing the legislation's potential. Ajayi is the head of tax, energy and natural resources at KPMG Nigeria , which provides audit, advisory, tax and regulatory services to various industries. (Note: Read our factsheet for more information on Nigeria's ailing refineries.) Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the size of a country's economy . It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. Data from Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics shows that the non-oil sector's contribution to GDP has fluctuated between 89% and 94% since 2014. Buhari became president in May 2015. In that quarter (April to June), the non-oil sector contributed 90.2% to GDP. It rose to 91.94% of GDP at the end of that year and then dropped to 89.98% in the first quarter of 2016. From 2016 to the end of 2020, the sector's contribution to GDP fluctuated almost every quarter, as can be seen in the graph below. The trend continues in 2021, with 90.75% in the first quarter and 92.58% in the second.  A recession is defined as \"two consecutive quarter-on-quarter negative growth rates\". The economy shrunk by 6.1% in the second quarter of 2020 after lockdowns and other Covid-19 restrictions began in March 2020. In the third quarter of the year, the economy shrank by 3.62% . Then in the fourth quarter of 2020, GDP grew by 0.11% . Buhari said agriculture remained key to his administration's \"economic diversification efforts\". The sector did indeed make up 22.35% of GDP in the first quarter of 2021, and 23.78% in the second quarter. The statistics bureau presents sectors' contributions to GDP in two ways. One is oil and non-oil. The other is agriculture, industries and services. GDP data shows that agriculture has consistently contributed over 20% to GDP at least since 2012, three years before Buhari became president in 2015. In the past five years, agriculture's contribution to GDP has been the second largest. Services have consistently led with over 50% for at least the past decade. See the chart below.  Buhari claimed that his administration had increased the proportion of people with access to potable water. The WHO defines \" potable water \" as safe drinking water that  \"does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption\". Nigerian law requires that all water supplies intended for human consumption must comply with the Nigerian Standards for Drinking Water Quality . These limit the concentration of substances known to be health hazards, or likely to be the subject of complaints from consumers. Among other things, drinking water acceptable by law in Nigeria should not be contaminated by E coli and other bacteria commonly found in faeces. The water standards were developed by the water resources ministry , the health ministry and the Standards Organisation of Nigeria . Basic drinking water vs safely managed water We traced Buhari's figure of 71% to a 2019 report on progress on household drinking water , sanitation and hygiene from 2000 to 2017 jointly produced by the World Health Organization and Unicef . The report says the share of Nigerians with access to at least basic water supplies rose from 48% in 2000 to 71% in 2017. The WHO and Unicef define basic drinking water as \"drinking water from an improved source, provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing\". Improved sources include piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water, according to the report. But it also says the percentage of Nigerians with access to \"safely managed water\" rose from 15% in 2000 to 20% in 2017. The report defines safely managed water as \"drinking water from an improved source that is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination\". Transporting water may lead to contamination The 2021 edition of the report looks at worldwide changes in drinking water, sanitation and hygiene from 2015 to 2020. For Nigeria, access to at least basic drinking water supplies rose from 69% in 2015 to 78% in 2020 . Access to safely managed water rose from 20% in 2015 to 22% in 2020 . Both basic and safely managed drinking could be considered potable water, Auwal Bappa, a water, sanitation and hygiene consultant with Unicef in northern Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"The ultimate goal is safely managed water but basic drinking water is also acceptable. Both are safe,\" he said. \"The main difference is that a basic water supply is located outside the home and so there is a higher chance of contamination in the course of transportation. However, the water fetched from a distance can still be treated at home. So both basic and safely managed can be considered potable water.\" Most water projects not by government Buhari's statistic about access to potable water is accurate but his claim that government water projects drove the increase is misleading. A 2019 survey by the water ministry, the statistics bureau, Unicef and other organisations found that federal, state and local governments provide less than 30% of all water points in Nigeria. The report says \" about 70% of all community water points are provided by non-government actors\". Water, sanitation and hygiene expert Priscilla Achakpa told Africa Check that civil society and private individuals were largely responsible for access to drinking water across Nigeria. Achakpa is the founder and global president of the Women Environmental Programme . She was the national coordinator of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council from 2017 to 2020. \"The majority of water projects in the country are done by NGOs or private individuals, and they are mostly boreholes. This is the situation in both rural and urban areas,\" she said. \"I know that not many Nigerians drink water supplied by government agencies.\" The 2021 report on progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, jointly produced by WHO and Unicef, provides figures for Nigeria's access to basic and safely managed drinking water in 2015 and 2020. It uses 181.14 million as Nigeria's population estimate in 2015, with 206.14 million in 2020. Some 69% of people had access to basic drinking water in 2015, according to the report. This comes to about 124.98 million people. In 2020, access to at least basic drinking water had risen to 78%, or 160.79 million people. This means about 35.8 million more Nigerians gained access to at least basic drinking water from 2015 to 2020. Buhari's claim of 12.5 million people is an understatement. Buhari's goal to ensure all states have good road networks has led him to invest large amounts of money i n road projects. But is his claim about the extent of those projects correct? Data from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing shows that the federal government is executing 895 contracts in 795 projects covering more than 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges nationwide. The National Home Grown School Feeding Programme was launched in 2016. Led by the government, it seeks to improve the health and education of children in public primary schools with N70 a day (around $0.17 at the time of publishing). Nigeria has 36 states, plus the federal capital territory (FCT). But despite the success of the feeding programme in 34 states and the FCT, Kwara and Bayelsa states are yet to implement it. In 2020, Kwara expressed interest in joining the programme and was even recorded as the 35th state to join , but hasn't rolled it out yet. 'N70 daily is not enough' Oriyomi Ogunwale, project lead at Eduplana , told Africa Check that while the claim was correct, there was a need to review the programme. \"N70 is not enough, and it has never been enough,\" he said. \"It should be increased to N200 or more. But we should not just focus on increasing the amount. We should look into monitoring and evaluation. There should be transparency and accountability.\" Eduplana is a civic tech organisation that uses data to advocate for quality education in Nigeria. Ogunwale said more information was needed on the programme, such as whether children were eating the food and its impact on school attendance.",

        "doc": "Up for re-election in August, Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta gave a sometimes impassioned defence of his record as part of the 2017 State of the Nation address , pegging it against his 2013 manifesto. Africa Check is working through his claims to sort fact from fiction. This report will be updated as new claims are completed. Security Claim \"Our ratio of police to the population is 1 officer for 380 citizens, better than the prescribed UN ratio of 1 officer for every 450 citizens.\" Verdict incorrect The police to population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has 1 police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. In its pre-election manifesto l a u n c h e d i n F e b r u a r y 2 0 1 3 , President Uhuru Kenyatta's ruling party pledged to \"increase the police-citizen ratio from 1:1,150 to a ratio of 1:800 citizens within five years...\". (Note: The actual ratio continues to vary - for example on 3 March Kenyatta said the ratio in 2013 \"was 1 policeman to 1,000 civilians\".) In a January 2017 speech , Kenyatta said that \" we now have 98,732 officers in our ranks compared to 78,885 in 2013, an increase of more than 25%\". In its 2013-2018 strategic plan , the National Police Service showed that 75,325 people (not 78,885) served in its three branches in 2013 . Africa Check contacted inspector-general Joseph Boinnet to clarify these numbers, but he is yet to provide the data, despite promising to do so. In March 2017, some 5,916 officers graduated. Using the president's numbers, this would bring the total number of police officers to 104,648. In its most recent estimate , the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics placed Kenya's population at 44.2 million in 2015. Using these numbers, the ratio works out to a policeman for every 422 Kenyans. For the ratio to be 1:380,  Kenya's current population would have to be to 39.8 million, or police numbers would need to increase to 116,315. Senior researcher for Amnesty International , Abdullahi Boru , reckons that the president was using Kenya's 2009 population estimate of 38.6 million people to work out the ratio, despite there being newer estimates of the population. A second issue with the ratio is that the UN defines police personnel as \"those whose principal functions are the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and the apprehension of alleged offenders\". The UN (which gets its data from the official data agency) therefore only includes the number of Kenya Police members, who are often referred to as the regular police, in its database. If we use the number of regular police members at last count by the National Police Service Commission (44,705), the ratio works out to 1 police officer for every 989 Kenyans . If we add the new recruits the ratio falls to 1:872. Africa Check was unable to find proof that the UN has ever recommended a ratio of 1:450. It seems to date back to the United States' policing of occupied Germany in 1945 when one American policeman oversaw 450 German civilians. Available literature shows that its success at the time has tended to inform international policing. Analysts we spoke to said the focus should be on the quality of policing , not absolute numbers . Devolution Claim \"My administration has gone over and beyond the constitutional requirement by increasing the percentage of shareable revenues [with Kenya's counties] from 15% to 34%.\" Verdict correct In 2010, a new constitution provided for the creation of 47 county governments. The sharing of revenue between them has generated considerable political debate including calls for a referendum to increase the share to the counties . The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of \"not less that 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government.  This amount is calculated using \"the most recent audited accounts of revenue received, as approved by the National Assembly.\" The Commission on Revenue Allocation is tasked with this, according to Jason Lakin , a research fellow at the International Budget Partnership . The agency's proposals are then submitted to parliament , w h i c h e n a c t s a l a w outlining what both the national government and counties are due. The commission's data shows that county governments got KSh190 billion in the 2013/14 financial year and KSh226.66 billion in the 2014/15 financial year. The most recent audited accounts were those of 2010/11, which showed the government had collected KSh608 billion. But because these had not been approved by the National Assembly as the chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee Mutava Musyimi told the House then, 2009/10 revenues were used. Based on this data, the revenue was KSh529.3 billion, meaning the allocations worked out to 28% of the \"most recent audited accounts of revenue\" that had been approved. The same base year was used for the 2014/15 allocation, with KSh226.66 billion going to the counties. This was 43% of the most recent audited and approved accounts of revenue. For the 2015/16 financial year, revenue data from 2012/13 was used, which showed KSh776.9 billion had been collected by the national government. The allocation to counties was KSh 259.8 billion, or 33%. Lawmakers further approved audited accounts for the financial year 2013/14, raising the base revenue to KSh935.5 billion. The counties got KSh302 billion, or 32.3% for the 2016/17 financial year. (Note: Treasury recorded KSh304.2 billion, or 33% of audited revenue.) Over the four years, allocation to Kenya's counties works out to an average 34% of the most recent audited accounts of revenues - above the constitutional threshold of \"not less than 15%\". Economy Claim \"Our gross domestic product has expanded at [a] strong average annual growth rate of 5.9% since 2013.\" Verdict unproven In its most recent quarterly report , the National Treasury says that Kenya's economy grew by 5.7 % in 2013, fell to 5.3 % in 2014 and recovered to 5.6 % in 2015. These figures are mirrored in the Economic Survey 2016 produced by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , the government's official data agency. For 2016, Treasury records average growth across the first, second and third quarters of 2016 at 5.9%, 6.2% and 5.7% respectively. For the economy to have expanded at an average of 5.9% since 2013, it would have needed to grow by 7% in 2016, or 10.2% in the last quarter of 2016 alone. The World Bank, in its October 2016 Kenya Economic Update f o r e c a s t full 2016 growth of 5.9% . The Parliamentary Budget Office - the non-partisan office that advises parliament on the budget and the economy - in a forecast released in March 2017 has predicted that the economy in 2016 would grow by 5.8%, with a slower Q4 growth of 5.4%. This, it says, is due to reduced rainfall, slower manufacturing output and the effects of an interest rate cap, which the president admitted was hurting lending. We have asked the presidency for the source of the president's economic numbers and will update this report with their response. In the absence of full 2016 data however, we find this claim unproven because evidence publicly available at this time neither proves nor disproves the statement. Despite this brisk growth, there has been concern that many Kenyans are not benefiting, sentiments that Kenyatta also acknowledged. Kwame Owino is the chief executive officer of the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank in Kenya. He said that despite the country's growth being above the regional average, it was not being felt in the country because the bulk of it was in big-money investment into a KSh447 billion standard-gauge railway project. Funded by a loan from China and with the main contractor being a Chinese firm, it is planned to connect the coastal city of Mombasa with the western Kenya border town of Malaba and is the current administration's flagship project. \"Most of what we are calling growth is driven by the standard-gauge railway. Most of the money is going back to China, and only a small share has percolated, so to speak, into the local economy, and even that is not distributed evenly,\" Owino told Africa Check. Claim \"Our debt is at about 50% of our gross domestic product.\" Verdict downplayed Kenyatta's reference to the country's public debt followed what he said were legitimate concerns that it might be too high. ( Note: Public debt is how much a government owes to lenders. It is not the same as external debt, which is what is owed to foreign investors by both the government and private entities. ) Preliminary International Monetary Fund findings put Kenya's debt at 52.1% of its gross domestic project in the 2015/16 financial year, which ended on 30 June 2016. This is compared to a 2014/15 debt ratio of 48.7% of GDP. ( Note: The IMF projects Kenya's debt to be at 52.5% of GDP in the current financial year, rising to 53.3% in 2017/18 .) As for calendar years, the ratio was at 48.6% of GDP in 2014 and 51.2% in 2015, rising to a projected 54.4% in 2016. Development economist Anzetse Were told Africa Check that rising debt may not be sustainable in the long run. This was due to ballooning non-productive spending, she said, citing recurrent expenditure such as salaries. \"The government needs to focus on getting the balance between recurrent and development expenditure right,\" she said. A 2010 World Bank study found that for developing economies, a debt-to-GDP ratio of 64% was the \"tipping point\" at which public debt would hurt economic growth. Public wage bill Claim \"In simple terms, 50% of all the money collected as revenues in Kenya goes into the pockets of less than 2% of the country's total population.\" Verdict correct The most recent estimate of Kenya's population is 44.2 million , contained in the 2015 Economic Survey by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Using this data, the country would need to have not more than 884,000 people on its public payroll. In his speech, Kenyatta said 700,000 public officers were being paid KSh627 billion, an amount he termed \"staggering\". A recent audit commissioned by Kenya's parliament and overseen by the auditor-general found that there were 700,700 public sector workers in 2013.  The bureau's Economic Survey captured 718,400 workers as contracted in 2015. Does their pay, which includes both salaries and allowances, take up more than half the government's revenue? The Kenya Revenue Authority is the principal tax collector of revenue in the country. The commissioner-general of the authority put tax collected in the financial year 2015/16 at KSh1.2 trillion. This figure is also backed up by the Treasury's Budget Review and Outlook Paper for 2016 which records that total tax revenue including appropriations-in-aid (budget jargon for monies that a department can retain, such as fees and levies) amounted to KSh1.237 trillion. The numbers thus appear to support the president's claim. Senior University of Nairobi lecturer Gerrishon Ikiara says the issue is clearly a major public concern as a higher wage bill means the country has less money to use on development. \"Controlling it is not easy due to a liberal constitution that has spurred strikes and also partisan interests,\" Ikiara, who focuses on economics and development studies, told Africa Check. \"An economical way of dealing with issues such as overrepresentation may be by tabling them at [upcoming elections], but also by picking leaders who see the bigger picture.\" Health Claim \"Today, we have doubled the numbers of expectant mothers delivering under the care of skilled medical attendants to over 1.2 million by the end of 2016.\" Verdict unproven When he took office in 2013, Kenyatta told parliament that he would \"expand and promote maternal, child and primary health care services\" and \"abolish all charges\" for women giving birth at public hospitals. Kenya's Demographic Health Survey of 2014 showed that between 2009 and 2014, 37% of births took place at home , while 61% were in a health facility. Nearly all of the births in a health facility were facilitated by a skilled medical attendant, translating to 62% of all births in the period surveyed. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data shows that of the 870,599 births registered in 2013, a total of 711,105 births (or 81.7%) took place in health facilities. In 2014, births in health facilities rose to 796,230 out of a total of 954,254 listed (or 83.4%). Provisional 2015 figures showed that 855,720 out of a total of 950,226 births - 90% - were in health facilities. The agency has yet to release 2016 data. Did the number of mothers delivering under the care of skilled attendants jump more than 40%, from 855,720 in 2015 to over 1.2 million a year later? In the absence of the latest data, it is impossible to say. Electrification Claim \"Today, we have connected an additional 3.7 million new homes to electricity.\" Verdict incorrect The supply of energy to Kenyans is the mandate of the national power utility company, Kenya Power . The ministry of energy has oversight over new connections, though, including through the Rural Electrification Project . In the last financial year of the preceding government, 2,330,962 customers were connected to the power grid . In the first full financial year of the Kenyatta administration (2013/14), the number of connections rose to 2,766,441. At the end of June 2016, Kenya Power noted that it had connected 4.89 million customers. When the head of Kenya Power, Ben Chumo, left the company in January 2017, he said that one of his major achievements was increasing the customer base from 2.2 million in 2013 to 5.5 million in 2016 - which would be an increase of 3.3 million. ( Note: These figures were echoed by energy cabinet secretary Charles Keter in a brief two days later. ) However, following media reports that nearly a million of these connections were inactive, Kenya Power said 974,173 connections were \" zero-vend \" ones (meaning no power units were bought since installation). It said reasons for this included low consumption, tampering and installations at unoccupied houses. Kenya Power has so far inspected 204,474 of these disputed connections, it said, but insisted that it had met its connectivity targets. However, even if they did, Kenya Power would have added at most 3.2 million customers, not 3.7 million as the president claimed. Infrastructure Claim \"With 1,950 km of new roads completed, and another 7,000 km in different phases of construction, we have kept the promise [to undertake the most aggressive road construction programme ever seen in Kenya].\" Verdict unproven In 2013, the new government promised \"to undertake the most aggressive road construction programme ever seen in Kenya\" . An infrastructure budget report issued in September 2016 showed that 1,194 km of new roads were constructed between 2013/2014 and 2015/16. That figure is also replicated in the Budget Policy Statement 2017 . According to the Economic Survey 2016 by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics , roads \"under bitumen\" increased from 11,300 km in July 2013 to 13,900 km by July 2015. However, the survey did not clarify whether this increase of 2,600 km was \"new roads\" or existing roads that had been tarred. In the data agency's Statistical Abstract 2016 , a table sourced from the Kenya Roads Board shows that the bitumen roads rose from 11,230 km in 2013 to 11,274 km in 2015 and 11,378 km in 2016, or only an additional 148 km. We have contacted the roads board for comment and will update this report with their response. Given the widely conflicting figures, we rate this claim as unproven until then.",

        "doc": "A newspaper article urging more recycling in Nigeria made a number of claims about the waste produced in the country. Its claim that Nigeria produced 0.65 kilograms of waste per person a day was mostly correct. But not data shows that the country generates over 62 tonnes of waste a year. Two claims on Lagos's waste generation and the city's population were unproven. Piling waste posed a \"grave danger\" to people in Nigeria, a national newspaper said, putting them at risk of environmental hazards and epidemics. As Africa's most populous country struggled to come to grips with the problem, recycling solid waste could help prevent disasters, Nigeria's Guardian said in May 2019 . The article made a number of claims about waste in Nigeria. We checked four of them. Claim \"Nigeria generates over 62 million tonnes of waste a year.\" Verdict incorrect The article's statistics were gathered during a development awards ceremony in Lagos in March 2019, its author Adaku Onyenucheya told Africa Check. She could not recall who had provided the figures as a recording had been lost. But she said she had been referring to waste in general, not only solid waste as the headline of the report suggests. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization defines waste as \"material left over after products have been made by producers and after they have been used by consumers\". We traced the figure of 62 million tonnes to a 2012 World Bank report t itled What a waste: A global review o f solid waste management . But the statistic was for sub-Saharan Africa. The report estimated that Nigeria alone produced 40,959 tonnes of municipal solid waste a day, or 14.95 million tonnes a year. It defined municipal solid waste as waste collected by municipalities from residences, industries, institutions and construction. The 2018 edition of the report has data for 2016, when solid waste generation in Nigeria rose to 34.6 million tonnes . But it did not have data on non-solid or liquid waste, according to the bank's Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience unit. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect based on the most recent publicly available national data. How were these figures calculated? To arrive at its most recent estimate, the World Bank relied on a number of sources. These included peer-reviewed journal articles and cited academic papers. Where data was not available, it relied on its studies and those from other donors or project documents. Models were then used to project future waste generation. These suggested that Nigeria would produce 54.8 million tonnes of solid waste in 2030, and 107 million tonnes in 2050. There was an acute lack of data on waste management in Nigeria and many other African countries, said Prof Oladele Osibanjo, president of the Lagos-based Waste Management Society of Nigeria . The National Bureau of Statistics told Africa Check it did not have data on waste generated by Nigerians. Waste generation was a \"highly variable parameter\" affected by factors such as the city and even the seasons, said Dr Chidozie Nnaji, a water resources and environmental engineering researcher at the University of Nigeria , Nsukka. Nnaji said most waste generation studies were localised, and there was a danger in \"over-generalising\" their results. Claim \"Each person [in Nigeria] generates an average of 0.65 kg of waste per day.\" Verdict mostly-correct In its 2018 report, the World Bank estimated that each person in Nigeria generated an average of 0.5 kilograms of solid waste a day in 2016. The report gave Nigeria' population as 186 million people in 2016. But the country's statistics bureau estimated the 2016 population at just over 193 million. There's been no official population count since 2006, and those figures were mired in controversy. Other sources showed that each person's average waste generation was close to the claim, analysts told Africa Check. A survey of waste management in Abuja by Chibueze Ogwueleka, published in 2013 , estimated it at 0.63 kilograms per person. Obiora Ezeudu is an environmental engineer and researcher at the centre for environmental management and control , University of Nigeria . He told Africa Check that this study \"assumed that Abuja has equal representation of all Nigerian entities in terms of culture and ethnicity and socio-economic\". These factors influenced the waste generation rate, Ezeudu said. Dr Thaddeus Nzeadibe, a senior lecturer in the geography department of the University of Nigeria , said Ogwueleka's rate of 0.63 kilograms per person was a sound estimate. \"I don't seem to have an idea of any other study done on Nigeria's per capita waste generation,\" said Nzeadibe, who has a doctorate in environmental management. \"His rate is a clear representation of Nigeria's per capita waste generation.\" But he added that \"because it was done in 2013, it is possible the rate would change if the study was done in 2019\". Claim \"Lagos has an estimated 21 million inhabitants.\" Verdict unproven In 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics estimated Lagos's population at 12.6 million . But this figure is contested. The Lagos state government's website says the population is 21 million, the number given in the Guardian's article. What could explain this difference? Dr Isiaka Olanrewaju is the data agency's director of household statistics . He told Africa Check that to e stimate Nigeria's 2016 population, the agency used both its own survey and projections from the National Population Commission. But Lagos took a different approach, Olarewaju said. \"The commission based its calculations on who was seen physically during the census, whereas Lagos state based its calculations on those who were usual residents of Lagos state, whether seen or not seen during the period.\" Claim \"Lagos has an estimated waste generation of over 15,000 tonnes every day.\" Verdict unproven The Lagos Waste Management Authority is responsible for the state's waste collection and disposal. Dr Ola Oresanya has headed the agency for more than 10 years. He chose to use a \"safe\" population figure 20 million, and estimated that an average person in Lagos generated 0.5 kilograms of waste daily. But this \"may have increased to 0.6 kilograms because of an increase in affluence and rate of generation\", he told Africa Check. The city produced about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of all forms of waste a day, he estimated. But, again, Lagos's population is contested, with estimates ranging from 12 million to 21 million. And the World Bank's 2018 report estimated that only 10% of the city's waste was collected. We therefore rate the claim as unproven.

        "doc": "By their very nature, State of the Nation addresses are tricky to fact-check. They are written by committees, the product of many hands and input from many government departments and agencies. The facts and figures that make the final cut are carefully selected and often stripped of nuance and context to present the most positive picture possible. This was President Jacob Zuma's sixth State of the Nation address and the last of his current term. You can read his full speech here . Being an election year, Zuma's speech borrowed heavily from the African National Congress manifesto and reflected on the ANC's claimed achievements over the past five years and twenty years. Viewed in isolation, many of the numbers he presented stand up. But they often lack context. We have endeavoured, as best we can, to evaluate Zuma's claims within a broader context. This is a look at some of the key claims that were made. Claim \"We have created 3.7 million work opportunities over the past five years.\" Verdict unproven The 2012/13 annual report of the Department of Public Works states that 3,054,027 \"work opportunities\" were created between April 2009 and March 2013. Zuma's claim can only be properly assessed when the figures for 2013/14 are released later this year. It is important to note that a \"work opportunity\" is not a permanent job. South Africa's department of public works defines a work opportunity as \"paid work created for an individual for any period of time \" as part of South Africa's expanded public works programme. Many \"work opportunities\" last only a few months. For instance , a \"work opportunity\" lasts an average of four months in the \"infrastructure sector\" and six months in the \"environment and culture\" sector. Ideally, these opportunities are meant to equip people with skills that can help them seek formal employment. It should be noted that even if 3.7-million \"work opportunities\" were created it does not mean that 3.7-million people gained work. If someone is hired for one project and then moves on to another and another, each period of employment is counted as a single \"work opportunity\". Claim \"The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61 percent in 2009 to 78 percent last year and the bachelor passes improve each year.\" Verdict misleading In 2009 the matric pass rate was 60.6%. It increased to 78.2% in 2013 . However, South Africa's high dropout rate means that many young people will never get the chance to write their matric examinations, let alone pass them. When the matric class of 2013 started grade two in 2003 there were 1,111,858 students. But by the time they came to sit for their final exams their numbers had fallen to 562,112. (Read our report on why the matric pass rate is not a reliable benchmark of education quality ) With regard to the second part of Zuma's claim, bachelor passes have not improved consistently each year since 2009. According to the education department, the number of bachelor passes increased from 109,697 in 2009 to 126,371 in 2010. But in 2011 the number of bachelor passes dipped to 120,767, before increasing to 136,047 in 2012 and 171,755 in 2013 . Claim \"The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300 thousand to more than 700 thousand between 2003 and 2011.\" Verdict correct In 2003 there were 315,387 students enrolled in Grade R, according to the basic education department. By 2011, enrolment had increased to 734,654. In 2013 , it had increased to 779,370. These figures include both public and independent schools. Claim \"Student enrolments at universities increased by 12% while further Education and Training college enrolments have increased by 90%.\" Verdict correct Zuma did not give dates for the increases but his claim appears to be supported by the Department of Higher Education and Training's 2012/13 annual report. It states that student enrolment at universities increased by 12% from 837,779 in 2009 to 938,201 in 2012/13. However, demand for university education far outweighs the number of places available. In 2013, the University of the Witwatersrand received over 35,000 applications for approximately 5,500 first year places Further Education and Training College enrolments increased from 345,566 in 2010 to 657,690 in 2012/13. Claim \"When 95% of households have access to water, the 5% who still need to be provided for, feel they cannot wait a moment longer. Success is also the breeding ground of rising expectations.\" Verdict unproven An odd statement. Without \"access to water\" people die. It follows that all South Africans therefore have some or other \"access to water\", be it piped, bottled, from water tankers, rain water tanks, streams or dams. What exactly Zuma means by the phrase is unclear, as is the source of the claim. We examined a number of similar claims in a report published last year . South Africa's water and environmental affairs minister, Edna Molewa, has previously claimed that 94.7% of South Africans have access to \"clean and safe drinking water\". Her spokesman, Mava Scott, claimed last year that 96.4% of all households had access to \"piped water\". The 2011 national census put the figure of households with \"access to piped water\" at 91.2%. The most recent general household survey , published last year by Statistics South Africa, states that 90.8% of households had \"access to piped water\" in 2012. The figures differ from province to province. In the Eastern Cape, for instance, only 79% of households  were found to have access to piped water. When we spoke to him last year, Scott explained that \"[w]hen we talk about piped water, we are normally referring to infrastructure and people have access to water coming out of that infrastructure\" . As recent violent water protests in South Africa's North West province have shown, having a tap in your yard, home or street, doesn't mean you have water or that the water is \"clean and safe\". Nationally there has been growing dissatisfaction over the quality of water. According to the general household survey , in 2012, \"60,1% of households rated the quality of water-related services they received as 'good'\". \"Satisfaction has, however, been eroding steadily since 2005 when 76,4% of users rated the services as good. Residents of Free State, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape have consistently been least satisfied with the quality of water. In 2012, 15,1% of households in Free State felt that their water smelled bad compared to 11,7% of Mpumalanga households and only 2,4% of Gauteng households. Free State households were most likely to feel that their water was unsafe to drink (15,1%), not clear (16,5%) and not tasting well (15,2%).\" Zuma's suggestion that recent violent service delivery protests can be attributed to the \"rising expectations\" of the \"5% who still need to be provided for\", has been characterised as \"spin-doctoring\" by a number of political commentators and opposition parties. We have been unable to find any reliable research that supports his contention. Claim \"Parliament is finalising amendments to the law to give effect to this very positive development, which will cut to under 300 days, the time it takes to start a mine, from application to final approvals.\" Verdict correct A typed copy of Zuma's speech that was circulated by Zuma's office quotes him referring to \"under 300 days\" as the time it will take to start a mine. But, while delivering his speech in parliament, Zuma referred to \"under 30 days\" . (Watch from 2:22:00) Zuma  appears to have misread the speech. His spokesman, Mac Maharaj, told Africa Check the correct figure is 300 days. Claim \"The tourism industry has grown dramatically. In 1993, South Africa received a mere 3 million foreign visitors. By 2012, the figure had grown to 13 million visitors.\" Verdict exaggerated Statistics South Africa indicates slightly more than 3-million foreign travellers came to South Africa in 1993. In earlier presentations , President Zuma has referred to a figure of 3,4-million foreign visitors for that year. The latest tourism report from StatsSA confirms that during 2012 \"about 13,8 million foreigners arrived in South Africa\". Not all of these, however, are considered tourists. StatsSA states 94,7% of foreign arrivals in 2012 were \"visitors\" of which 29,7% were \"same day visitors\" and 70,3% \u2013 or 9,2-million people \u2013 were overnight visitors or \"tourists\". The balance were classed as business travellers, students and workers. StatsSA defines \"tourist\" as an overnight visitor, and tourism as \"the activities of persons travelling to, and staying in places outside their usual environment, for not more than one consecutive year, for leisure, business and other purposes.\" SADC countries are the single biggest source of foreign visitors to South Africa, accounting for more than 70% of all tourists. This figure/proportion is consistent with previous decades \u2013 the 1996 White Paper on Tourism indicates 73% of all international arrivals in 1995 were from African countries. Aurelia Segatti, a researcher at the African Centre for Migration & Society explains that, as most SADC nationals, and citizens of many other countries, may enter the country for up to 90 days on a tourist visa, a \"tourist\" stamp does not necessarily give us an indication of individual motives for entering South Africa \u2013 and that many of these reasons may fall outside the sightseeing and curio-buying  associated with \"tourism\". Segatti says that, although it is not possible to do a qualitative breakdown of exactly how many foreign visitors come to South Africa for exactly which reasons, many are involved in trade,  \"coming to Johannesburg and shopping in malls, and getting goods back to [their] place of origin\". Many of these traders travel with their relatives. There are people who also come to visit friends and family in South Africa. Some travel for  medical reasons in order to seek private healthcare or to access public healthcare facilities. People also \"visit\" South Africa in an attempt to illegally enter the South African labour market. Claim \"The overall crime rate has decreased by 21 percent since 2002\u2026\" Verdict misleading The decrease in the overall crime rate claimed by Zuma refers only to the period  2002/2003 to 2011/2012. It excludes the most recent 2012/2013 crime statistics which have shown worrying increases in a number of categories of serious and violent crime. On the face of it, Zuma's claim appears to be supported by a 2012 fact sheet prepared by South Africa's Institute for Security Studies which stated that \"[s]ince the 2002/03 financial year, when total crime levels peaked in South Africa, the overall crime rate has decreased by 21%\". But the fact-sheet also pointedly cautioned that overall crime rates do not give us useful information in terms of increases or decreases in specific crime categories, with respect to regional crime rate changes, or the reasons for the change in crime rates. Without this context, the victory-against-crime claim recycled in the president's State of the Nation address becomes almost meaningless. Zuma's claim deliberately selects 2002 \u2013 a period when \"total crime levels peaked in South Africa\" \u2013 as its benchmark. While overall crime rates may have decreased by 21% between 2002 and 2012, the ISS noted that \"overall levels of crime [for 2011/2012] are actually quite compar[a]ble with the levels recorded in 1994/1995\". The decline in crime has also not been uninterrupted. According to the ISS, a \"3% increase in total crime levels was recorded in the two-year period between 2007/08 and 2009/10\", which was followed by marginal decreases in the subsequent two years. Gareth Newham, head of the Institute's governance, crime and justice division says that crime levels have seen an overall increase in the last two years, driven by increases in property crime and, more recently, serious violent crimes. In Newham's view, Zuma's annual address should have focused on \"what has happened in the last year, not distracting us by discussing the last ten years. \"In the last year all forms of serious and violent crimes \u2013 including murder, attempted murder, house robbery, street robbery \u2013 all of these have increased. Murder is of particular concern, because the [murder rate] had been coming down \u2013 and this is the first time murder has increased in seven years.\" Claim \"On average, the economy has grown at 3,2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.\" Verdict mostly-correct According to the World Bank \"GDP growth in South Africa has averaged 3.2% a year since 1995 \". This is confirmed by Africa's Check's own calculations based on real GDP tables. While Zuma's numbers were correct, the context was noticeably lacking. Economic growth \u2013 evaluated in terms of real GDP \u2013 has slowed in recent years. In 2012, South Africa's GDP growth fell to 2.5%. The World Bank estimated GDP growth at just 1.9% for 2013,  the lowest since the 2009 recession. It is expected to increase to a projected 2.7% for 2014. Rian le Roux, chief economist at Old Mutual, says that since 1994 the economy has seen \"periods of bad growth and times when the economy did quite well\", the latter boosted by global commercial booms, and local infrastructure and credit booms. \"The question is what is the growth potential at the moment and that's probably less than 3%.\" This figure, le Roux says, means there will be insufficient growth to address the backlog of unemployment or drive the creation of new jobs, and means that even where jobs are created they may not be sustainable. This view is supported by a recent statement from the International Monetary Fund , which praises South Africa's strong macroeconomic policies but points out that the country's economic performance has been slower and lower than other emerging markets \u2013 and that the current growth rate \"creates jobs, but not enough for the growing labor [sic] force and those currently without work\". Le Roux says that to \"overcome the backlog of 20 years of isolation we need to have fast economic growth\". \"There are 500,000 new matriculants who can't find jobs. The youth subsidy will not make much of a dent. We have got to raise the growth rate and increase the labour absorption capacity of the private sector.\" Addressing issues like low business confidence and problematic labour relations will, le Roux says, create more favourable business conditions and \"make people want to invest in South Africa.\" Claim \"Jobs are now being created again.There are now 15 million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650 thousand jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.\" Verdict misleading According to latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey published by StatsSA, 15,177,000 people were employed in the last quarter of 2013 and 653,000 jobs were created in the last year. What Zuma failed to acknowledge is that the unemployment rate in South Africa is higher today than it was before the recession. Prior to the recession South Africa's unemployment rate was 21.9%. According to StatsSA, 4,830,000 South Africans are classified as unemployed , resulting in an unemployment rate of 24.1%. But StatsSA uses a very narrow definition of \"unemployment\" which refers only people who are unemployed but actively seeking work. An \"expanded rate\" of unemployment - which includes people who do not have a job and are available to work but have not taken active steps to look for work - suggests that unemployment levels were as high as 34% in the fourth quarter of last year . Claim \"Mother to child transmission of HIV has declined sharply.\" Verdict correct A recent study published by the World Health Organisation showed that mother-to-child transmission of HIV in South Africa dropped from 8,5% in 2008 to 3,5% in 2010 and 2,7% in 2011. Claim \"[W]e have doubled the number of people who are receiving anti-retroviral treatment, from one million to 2.4 million people in 2013.\" Verdict misleading This could be read to mean that during 2013 the number of people on anti-retroviral treatment doubled from 1-million to 2.4-million. That is not the case. StatsSA estimated that there were 1,058,399 adults and 105,123 children receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2010. Using data from the Department of Health, the 2012/13 District Health Barometer , estimated that  2,161,170 adults were on anti-retroviral treatment by the end of 2012/13. But, as the Barometer pointed out, the number of adults on anti-retroviral treatment could be overestimated if patients are not excluded from counts when, for example, they die or fail to adhere to the programme. Other concerns about the counts have also been raised .The fact that people are receiving anti-retroviral treatment does not mean they are currently taking it or will continue to take it. It's also not clear how tests are counted. Are people who get tested multiple times counted once per test or only once? We have asked the department for clarity and will update the report if they respond. In response to some of the criticisms, South Africa's health minister,  Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, has argued that South Africa's increasing life expectancy suggests that people are adhering to their treatment. Claim \"More than 20 million South Africans have taken the HIV test since the launch of the campaign in 2011 which indicates confidence in the health system.\" Verdict mostly-correct South Africa's HIV counselling and testing campaign was launched in April 2010, not 2011. According the country's health department, the available data suggests that 9.7-million people had been tested by the end of 2010/11 . In 2011/2012 the department claims that 8.7-million people were tested. In 2012/13 , it says close to 9-million people were tested for HIV. The department's 2013/14 annual report will only be released later this year, but calculations based on figures in previous annual reports indicate that  around 27-million people have been tested since the launch of the campaign in 2010, well above Zuma's claim. But there appear to be serious discrepancies in the department's figures. The 2012/13 annual report states that 20-million people were tested in 2010/11. However, this is contradicted by the 2010/11 annual report which states that 9.7-million people were tested in that year. It should also be noted that while the programme reported testing almost 9-million people in 2012/13, the department failed to meet its target of 18-million tests. Claim \"In housing, about 3 million housing units and more than 855 thousand serviced sites were delivered since 1994.\" Verdict mostly-correct The Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation's latest development indicators show that about 3.3-million housing units have either been completed or are \"in progress\". According to Xolani Xundu, a spokesman in the Department of Human Settlements, 2,799,702 \"houses and units\" were delivered from 1994 to December 2013. He says the number of \"serviced sites\" delivered over that period came to 876,774. A 2013 report by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) pointed out that housing figures from different government sources are often contradictory. Claim \"Nearly 500 informal settlements have been replaced with quality housing and basic services over the past five years.\" Verdict unproven According to the Department of Human Settlements the figure is correct, but the data does not exist in a single collated form, and should refer only to basic services as it does not necessarily include housing. The department's Victor Rajkumar told Africa Check there were  \"myriad source documents\" from which the department gathered its information. While no \"list\" exists showing that 500 informal settlements have been upgraded, Rajkumar says data from various sources indicates \"at least 500 interventions or upgrading interventions\" in informal settlements. Defining the extent and status of informal settlements in South Africa remains a contentious issue. The current baseline used to measure the number of informal settlements in South Africa comes from 2009. It states that there are approximately 2,700 informal settlements across the country, and that households in these settlements continue to grow at around 3% per annum.  (According to the human settlements department, this figure will be updated during the course of 2014) A recent report from the Housing Development Agency suggests that the number of households living in informal settlements has stabilised since 2001. In 2011 there were approximately 1,66-million households in informal residential areas or shacks not in a backyard. Kate Tissington from the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) told Africa Check that while government \"likes to talk about upgrading settlements\", the reality is that very little has been done. According to Tissington, \"delivery figures around informal settlement upgrading are often very ambiguous, sometimes referring to formal housing projects and often hiding the removal of people from settlements and the growth of households living in backyard shacks\". Claim \"Since 1994, nearly 5,000 farms, comprising 4.2 million hectares, have been transferred to black people, benefiting over 200,000 families.\" Verdict mostly-correct Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti told Parliament last year that  4,813 farms had been transferred to black people and communities between 1994 and 2013, benefiting 230,886 people. In 2012, a survey by the South African Institute of Race Relations found that 2,864 farms had been redistributed by August 2009. Between 2009 and 2012, 848 farms were acquired, giving a total of 3,712 farms by 2012. The survey found there were over 220,000 beneficiaries by March 2012. The accuracy of the official government figures have however been questioned. Dr Peter Jacobs, a research specialist in economic performance and development at the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), told Africa Check discrepancies exist between figures compiled by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, the National Treasury and \"various researchers\". South Africa's land reform programme has been dogged by controversy amid reports of farms failing and projects collapsing. A survey of land reform and restitution projects presented at a 2013 conference on agrarian reform organised by the HSRC, indicated that one third of 301 households surveyed were not actively using the land they had received. \"Within that third there are some [people] that have taken big loans, they are failing to pay back and in those cases the land has been taken back by the banks,\" said Dr Jacobs. In recent years senior government officials, including Nkwinti, have repeatedly stated that over 90 per cent of the land transferred through the land reform programme is not productive . Professor Ben Cousins, the founder of the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (Plaas) has argued that \"the actual failure rate is more like 50%, and a further 30% are struggling\". To address the challenge, government embarked on a recapitalisation and development programme . By March 2013, 1,351 farms were reported to have been recapitalised , at a cost of R2.14-billion. Jacobs believes that land reform and redistribution projects have thus far failed to bring about transformation and have created a rural elite that benefits more than the poor. According to Cousins \"there are some success stories, but a great many failures too\" for \"beneficiaries who have been told (or chosen) to enter into strategic partnerships with businesses\". Zuma's speech also made no mention of the fact that far less than 10% of the land earmarked for redistribution has been transferred. The initial target, set in 2009, was that 30% of the land that was historically in the hands of \"white commercial farmers\" would be redistributed by 2014. \"Government is not likely to transfer the remaining 20% of land within the next 20 to 30 years,\" Jacobs believes. Claim \"Nearly 80,000 land claims, totalling 3.4 million hectares, have been settled and 1.8 million people have benefited.\" Verdict mostly-correct A total of 67,531 land claims had been submitted by 1999. A backlog in processing saw this number grow to a total of 79,696 claims. By the end of 2012 nearly 96% of these claims had reportedly been settled. The  2012/2013 annual report of the Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights states:  \"A total of 77,334 claims have been settled to date. Of these, 71,292 claims were settled by payment of financial compensation of R6,561,021,691 to claimants.\" The annual report also indicates that a \"total of 111,278 people benefitted from the restitution programme in the 2012/13 financial year\". An earlier Progress Report on Land Restitution Claims delivered to the Portfolio Committee On Rural Development and Land Reform in February 2012 indicated that, between 1995 and January 2012, a total of 76,506 claims had been settled which impacted on 1,662,099 beneficiaries. When the 2012/13 figure of 111,278 is added to this, it results in a total of 1,773,377 individuals.",

        "doc": "During his chat with journalists, Ruto was correct to claim that his government had lowered the cost of fertiliser. He was also right that a gas power plant produced expensive electricity, while hydropower was much cheaper. A claim about geothermal energy was unproven. He was incorrect to say that Kenya had the third highest number of livestock in Africa. But a claim about the size of the country's economy \"in the region\" was mostly correct. For the first time since he was elected , Kenyan president William Ruto invited members of the media to a discussion at State House, his official residence. He answered questions about topics such as his administration's promises to create jobs, lower the cost of living, boost food security and improve manufacturing. Africa Check vetted six of his claims. We asked spokesperson Hussein Mohamed for the source of the president's data. Mohamed said he would send it to us, and we will update this report when we get it. Fertilisers contain chemicals that help improve the growth and productivity of plants. Agriculture makes up a fifth ( 22.4% ) of Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), a common measure of the size of an economy. When Ruto was sworn in on 13 September 2022, he promised to lower the price of a 50 kilogram bag of fertiliser from KSh6,500 (about US$50) to KSh3,500 ($30). This was just before the start of Kenya's rainy season , which runs from October to December. The agriculture ministry announced the lower price a week later. It said farmers could buy the subsidised fertiliser from the National Cereals and Produce Board . The board later posted photos online of farmers collecting the fertiliser. In October farmers interviewed by the media said that they had bought the fertiliser at the lower price . We therefore rate the president's claim as correct. Commercial fertiliser prices remain high But it's a different story on the open market.  Here a 50kg bag of fertiliser can cost more than KSh5,000 ($40), and in some instances as much as KSh9,000 ($70). A 2018 study by the Alliance for Green Revolution , a nonprofit working in 11 African countries, estimated that private importers provide half the fertiliser used in Kenya. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The gas turbine plant in Muhoroni, a town in southwestern Kenya about 300 kilometres from the capital Nairobi, has a capacity of 60 megawatts (MW).The plant helps stabilise the fragile power grid in western Kenya. Thermal power plants \u2013 like the Muhoroni gas plant \u2013 burn fuel that boils water, producing steam. The steam then drives electricity generators . This is in contrast to hydropower plants, where falling water drives the generators. Ruto used the Muhoroni plant as an example of the high cost of energy in Kenya, due to thermal generation . He compared it to the cost of electricity from hydropower sources , produced at four US cents per kilowatt hour. A kilowatt hour (KWh) measures the energy used by an electrical device. It's the measure seen on your electricity bill. The Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) operates the Muhoroni plant and sells the electricity generated to Kenya Power , the state utility. Kenya Power said they would send us information on the plant, but have not yet done so. A presidential task force reviewing controversial power purchase agreements in Kenya has also struggled to access this information. So we checked the firm's most recent annual report . In the 2021/22 financial year, Kenya Power bought 40 gigawatt hours (GWh), or 40 million KWh, from the Muhoroni plant at KSh2.03 billion. This works out to KSh50.69 for every kilowatt hour. ( Note: The World Bank calculates the cost of power in dollars per kilowatt hour. ) In 2021, according to the most recent economic survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics ,  one US dollar cost an average of KSh109.65. At that rate, Kenya Power bought each kilowatt hour from Muhoroni for 46.23 US cents. The gas plant's output accounted for only 0.5% of the 7,911 GWh the utility bought that financial year. But proportionately, it cost nearly 10 times this, or 4.2%, of the total KSh48.4 billion Kenya Power spent to buy electricity. Ruto's claim about the plant's high cost is mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma KenGen produces electricity from 14 hydropower plants. ( Note: See here for more details about how electricity is generated. ) Nine of these \u2013 including Gitaru, Kiambere and Turkwel \u2013 are large plants. Five are much smaller . In the 2021/22 financial year, Kenya Power bought 3,157 GWh, or 3.157 billion KWh, from eight of the large plants. This works out to KSh2.74 per KWh. The Sang'oro station is one of the nine larger hydros, but for unclear reasons is treated separately in the annual report. The bill for the 10 GWh, or 110 million KWh, bought from the plant comes to KSh752 million, or KSh6.83 per KWh. The average cost of electricity from the large hydros is therefore KSh4.79. This works out to 4.36 US cents at the 2021 exchange rate of KSh109.65. The report also lumps wind power with the small hydropower stations. Without more detailed data from Kenya Power, we are unable to work out an exact figure. But the available data does back up Ruto's claim . \u2013 Makinia Juma We asked the State House spokesperson what Ruto meant by \" capped \" geothermal energy. We will update this report should we hear back. Geothermal energy is the natural heat stored in the earth's crust. To produce it, wells are drilled deep underground, and the resulting steam drives large turbines that produce electricity. Kenya has geothermal potential of up to 10,000 MW , according to the country's energy regulator. So far, 828 MW is \" installed capacity \", or \"the maximum theoretical electric output a power station can produce when operating at 100%\". ( Note: Kenya Power has a higher figure of 950 MW. ) In its most recent annual report, published in 2020, the state-run Geothermal Development Company said it had a target of increasing its capacity to 1,065 MW, by 2030. Projects totalling 430 MW are in development, according to the chief executive's statement in the report. Most of this is in partnership with KenGen, which put out a statement on the day Ruto spoke to the media. There is publicly available data showing that 400 MW or so is being developed. But without confirmation from Ruto's spokesperson it is unclear whether the president was referring to this. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi In making this claim , the president was talking about the potential of Kenya's leather industry. We traced the claim to a 2015 World Bank study on the industry. This said that \"Kenya is the third largest livestock holder in Africa\".

He said we should check with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for data on livestock numbers. FAO lists 18 categories of livestock, from bees and chickens to buffalos, cattle and horses. Njagi said we should focus on camels, cattle, goats and sheep as these are \"referred to as traditional livestock.\" They are also the animals listed in 2012 government research on the leather industry. Njagi also said that since the Covid pandemic, Kenya has lost a significant number of its poultry, as farmers opted out due to high food costs . This volatility is also why our focus is on \"traditional\" livestock. FAO uses the official numbers. When these are unavailable, it turns to \"non-official sources or historical data\". The agency's most recent figures are from 2021. Below is a ranking of African countries by livestock holding: Top African countries by traditional livestock numbers Rank Country Number 1 Ethiopia 153,336,110 2 Nigeria 146,386,010 3 Chad 128,196,687 4 Sudan 110,399,490 5 Kenya 84,653,025 6 Mali 64,490,817 7 Tanzania 58,513,921 8 Niger 52,708,573 9 South Sudan 42,018,450 10 Burkina Faso 38,832,387 Source: FAO 2021 . See our calculations here . By this breakdown, Kenya has the fifth \u2013 not third \u2013 highest number of livestock in Africa. The chief statistician at the FAO also told Africa Check that \"Kenya is not the third-largest livestock holder in Africa regardless of any type of livestock\". The organisation used numbers from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics on livestock production and data on livestock, and the net livestock trade, or total imports less exports. The agency also shared this table from their publicly available database that shows \"live animals\". \"The analysis shows that in 2020/21, Kenya is the eighth livestock holder in Africa (all types of livestock combined),\" the FAO said in an email. \"It should be noted that different data sources and methods to derive figures used to rank countries will give different rankings.\" \u2013 Tess Wandia Ruto made this claim during a discussion of Kenya's interventions in conflicts in several African countries. We have asked his spokesperson what he meant by \"region\". Kenya has its military in missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Somalia . Former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta is mediating the conflicts in the DRC and Ethiopia, while the government is also concerned about conflict in South Sudan. During the discussion, Ruto said that he travelled to Ethiopia, Uganda, DRC, and South Sudan in 2022 to discuss regional stability. \"We have a huge interest in the stability of this region. If this region is unstable, the biggest hit will be on our economy,\" he said . Kenya shares a border with five countries: Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is also part of the East Africa Community (EAC), made up of seven countries \u2013 Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, DRC, Rwanda and Burundi. Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and Ethiopia are part of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) , which has eight members . The others are South Sudan, Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea. Then there is the Eastern Africa Standby Force , a combined military set up to \"enhance peace and security in the eastern Africa region\". Its 10 members are Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda. What the data shows We checked for the most recent data from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the 14 countries mentioned above. The World Bank's most recent GDP data is for 2021. But it last tracked Eritrea's GDP in 2011, and South Sudan's in 2015. The data shows that in the EAC, Kenya has the largest economy, at US$110.3 billion. It has the second largest economy in the Igad region, after Ethiopia's $111.3 billion. The IMF released new GDP estimates in October 2022 , showing that Kenya was the largest economy among the 14 countries. The IMF data also shows the Kenyan economy has consistently outperformed Ethiopia's. Here is a table showing the breakdown, region and size of the economy based on the two data sources. Therefore we rate Ruto's claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Tess Wandia Editor's note: This article was updated on 27 January 2022 to include comments and data from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). This does not change the verdict.",

        "doc": "Nigerians are set to vote for a new president on 25 February 2023 as the second and final term of current president Muhammadu Buhari comes to a close. The Candidates, a series of live televised town hall meetings, allowed five presidential hopefuls to state their case and answer questions. Notably missing were leading candidates Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu. Africa Check and our partners in the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time, on social media. Here is a shorter and more contextual report on that work. Campaigns are in full gear as Nigeria's 2023 presidential election comes steadily into view. The presidential election \u2013 and elections for the national assembly \u2013 is set for 25 February . And in a bid to win voters, the major presidential candidates and their deputies have been appearing on The Candidates , a series of town hall meetings aired on live TV. The series began on 17 November with Adewole Adebayo, the Social Democratic Party candidate. Other candidates in the series are Omoyele Sowore of the African Action Congress , Rabiu Kwankwanso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party and Peter Obi of the Labour Party . Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party skipped the town halls. He was replaced with Kola Abiola of the Peoples Redemption Party . Also notably absent was Bola Tinubu of the governing All Progressives Congress . Each candidate had two hours to outline their plans and respond to questions from the moderator, Kadaria Ahmed . Questions were also taken from the audience in the studio and online. We and the rest of the Nigerian Fact-checkers' Coalition fact-checked each of the five sessions live and posted a summary of our findings on social media. This is a more contextual report of those findings. To keep things shorter, we have left out some claims that were straightforward and correct. They include claims about Nigeria's life expectancy and whether agriculture employs the most labour in the country. Candidate: Adewole Adebayo , Social Democratic Party (SDP) Adebayo argued that the administration of outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari had mismanaged the economy, including its vital crude oil and natural gas resources. He claimed that as much as 80% of Nigeria's crude oil was being stolen. The theft of the country's main export has been widely reported . But are as many as eight of every 10 barrels of oil produced in Nigeria stolen? The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission regulates oil and gas production. As part of this, it tracks how much oil is produced. In June 2022, agency chief executive Gbenga Komolafe was quoted saying that in the first three months of the year, oil theft had been estimated at a daily average of 120,000 barrels. In that period, Nigeria's central bank recorded production at more than 1.2 million barrels every day \u2013 an average of 1.4 million in January, 1.26 million in February and 1.24 million in March. The estimated figure of 120,000 barrels is less than 10% of oil produced. Others have given higher estimates of up to 400,000 barrels a day , but this still does not translate to 80% of the country's output. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Adebayo said the Central Bank of Nigeria 's performance has been poor and included the mismanagement of monetary policy. As a solution, he pledged to pick an economist \u2013 for \"the first time in a long time\" \u2013 as the bank's governor. Nigeria has had four central bank governors since its return to multiparty democracy in 1999. Two of them were economists, one appointed as recently as 2014. Joseph Sanusi , in office from 1999 to 2004, is an accountant. He studied accounting and has experience in capital markets and banking. Chukwuma Soludo , the governor from 2004 to 2009, is a professor of economics. He trained at institutions such the Brookings Institution in the US and the University of Cambridge in the UK. Soludo's successor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi , has a bachelor's degree in economics and taught economics at Ahmadu Bello University before going into banking. He was governor from 2009 to 2014. The current bank governor, Godwin Emefiele , has been in office since 2014. He studied banking and finance and taught finance and insurance at two Nigerian universities before beginning his banking career. But is it important that the bank be led by an economist? Yes, it is important for the governor of the central bank to be an economist, we were told by Ifuero Osamwonyi, a professor of finance at the University of Benin in southern Nigeria. \"The governor of CBN needs to be experienced in macroeconomic modelling. The person needs to be grounded in matters of monetary policy and the macroeconomics of the country and the world,\" he said. Macroeconomics is concerned with factors that affect the whole economy, such as unemployment, inflation and economic growth. In Osamwonyi's view, Soludo has been the most qualified of the bank's governors so far, due to his work in macroeconomics before his time in office. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Candidate: Omoyele Sowore , African Action Congress (AAC) Sowore, an activist and media entrepreneur, is a well-known critic of the government . He attributed Nigeria's electricity challenge to a succession of governments. He then repeated a claim that has been making the rounds for more than a decade \u2013 that the Nigerian government has spent US$16 billion on electricity and still failed to solve the problem. The claim is often made in reference to the spending of president Olusegun Obasanjo's administration on what were known as the National Independent Power Projects during its term from 1999 to 2007. Obasanjo governed under the Peoples Democratic Party, which is hoping to succeed the APC. But is the claim correct? Despite being alluded to several times by APC leaders and Buhari officials, there are still no publicly available official records that support this. A 2017 report by the Lagos-based nonprofit Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project found the Obasanjo administration spent $10 billion and not $16 billion on the power projects. A year later Obasanjo shared the findings of a 2007 probe by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission . This found far lower spending on the projects: about N1.23 trillion (US$9.64 billion) . But only about N360.7 billion ($2.8 billion at the official exchange rate of N127.5 to $1 in May 2007) had been paid out when Obasanjo left office. And the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (formerly the National Electric Power Authority), which oversaw the projects, received N273.65 billion from 1999 to 2007. That comes to $2.15 billion, using the average 2007 exchange rate. This still does not add up to the $16 billion claimed. And in a more recent probe, in 2019, the anti-graft watchdog again did not find evidence of this level of spending. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Sowore said Nigeria's insecurity problem could not be solved without investments in social security or policies that aim to cushion individuals and households against possible hardships. China had more guns than Nigeria but it resolved its security challenges by investing a lot in social security, he said. A 2018 survey estimated that there were 6.2 million firearms in the hands of civilians in Nigeria, or 3.21 firearms per 100 people. The research found civilians in China held 49.7 million firearms, or 3.58 firearms per 100 people . The data shows that China has more guns, both in absolute numbers and per population, in the hands of civilians than Nigeria. What about illegal firearms? It is difficult to estimate how many illegal weapons are in the hands of Nigerian civilians, Sam Smah, a professor of criminology and criminal justice administration at the National Open University of Nigeria in Abuja, told Africa Check. \"The estimate I am working with is about 10 million illegal firearms in Nigeria. The majority of the illegal firearms circulating in West Africa are in Nigeria. I know that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Development Programme and a West African agency have done surveys on this,\" he said. Smah said conflicts in the Sahel and the \"collapse of security\" in some parts of northern Nigeria had led to high traffic in illegal weapons, which were almost impossible to track. \"Recently, I heard president Buhari say that some of the firearms from the war in Ukraine are being diverted to Nigeria.\" A 2021 presentation by UNODC says it is estimated that 70% of over 10 million illegal weapons in circulation in West Africa are in Nigeria. But it  notes that there is little to no data to prove this. \u2013 Allwell Okpi The media have reported that president Buhari, first elected in 2015, tried to meet hi s campaign promise \"to look at the presidential air fleet with a view to cutting down on waste\". Two planes from the fleet were put up for sale in 2016 . In September 2020 the presidenc y reportedly tried to sell another aircraft . But there is no evidence any of the sales have gone through . The cost of maintaining the fleet has reportedly risen by over 120% in the past eight years. This does not mean new planes were added. We found no evidence that the Buhari administration has added any new planes to the presidential fleet. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Candidate: Rabiu Kwankwaso , New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) Rabiu Kwankwaso was governor of the northwestern Nigerian state of Kano from 1999 to 2003. He returned in 2011 for another term, which ended in 2015. He has repeatedly claimed he did not borrow money to run his administration during both terms as governor. But available evidence does not support the claim. The national media reported that Kwankwaso borrowed N4.1 billion from pension funds to build th e Bandirawo, Amana and Kwankwasiya housing estates , a \"mega city\" project that he hoped to leave as a legacy. Data from the country's Debt Management Office (DMO) show that Kano state's domestic debt, owed to Nigerian banks, increased by nearly N60 billion from 2011 to 2015. Kwankwaso's second term began on 29 May 2011. The DMO later published a report that showed Kano's domestic debt was N5.87 billion at the end of December 2011. By the end of December 2015, it had jumped to N65 billion . Kwankwaso left office on 29 May 2015. But since the DMO only publishes state-level data at the end of the year, we were not able to establish the exact debt at his departure. Data from the agency does show that the state's external debt, owed to other countries or multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, dropped slightly during the period . External debt was $63.9 million on 30 June 2011. It dropped to $59.8 million on 30 June 2015 . \u2013 Allwell Okpi Kwankwaso was Kano governor from 1999 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2015. Data from the debt office shows the state owed $59.8 million to external creditors as of 30 June 2015 \u2013 a month after he left the office. The office didn't publish data for domestic debt in June 2015. But at the end of that year, Kano's domestic debt was N65 billion . Kwankwaso's successor, Umar Ganduje, told journalists two days after he became governor that there was nothing wrong with Kwankwaso's administration leaving the state with over N300 billion in debt . We could not find independent data on Kano's debt profile when Kwankwaso left office in 2003. Publicly available official data only goes back to 2006. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Kwankwaso said that if he were elected, he would ensure the national budget for education would be more than what the country currently spends, as he had done when he was governor of Kano state. He referred to a widely quoted \"25% recommendation\" for education funding he said was by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Education (Unesco). There is no evidence the UN agency has such a recommendation. In 2017, Nigeria's education minister Adamu Adamu debunked a similar claim of a \"26% Unesco recommendation\". He said Unesco officials had confirmed the agency has not recommended such a benchmark. The only recommendation we found is that of a 2015 global education monitoring report commissioned by Unesco. The report proposed that governments should spend 4% to 6% of their gross national product, or 15% to 20% of their national budget, on education. But Unesco said it did not represent its opinion. Kwankwaso set aside less than 25% of Kano's budget for education Budget data on the Kano state website dates back only to 2016. But we found other documents online that show how much was budgeted for education in Kano under Kwankwaso's administration. In his 2012 budget speech to the state assembly, Kwankwaso proposed a total budget of N210.38 billion . \"Mr Speaker, we are determined to address the apparent collapse of the education sector. We thus plan to spend a total of N35 billion on education,\" he was quoted as saying . The N35 billion was 16.6% of the total budget. N221.62 billion was eventually approved , with education getting a total of N35.5 billion, or 15.9% . The 2015 budget, the last of Kwankwaso's Kano governorship, allocated N29.55 billion to the education ministry and N18.83 billion to the higher education ministry.  That meant the total education budget was N48.38 billion. The N48.38 billion amounted to 23% of Kano's total budget of N210 billion in 2015. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Candidate: Peter Obi , Labour Party Responding to a question on how he would reduce the budget deficit if elected, Peter Obi gave the country's 2021 budget as N21 trillion, with a N11 trillion shortfall. Obi is running on the Labour Party ticket. A deficit is the difference between what a government earns and what it spends. Budget office documents show N13.6 trillion was budgeted for the 2021 budget, and not N21 trillion. The budget deficit for that year was also lower, at N5.6 trillion . Obi's claim about a N11 trillion deficit would have been correct if he was referring to the 2023 budget . \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Expressing his position on the country's several different exchange rates , Obi said the naira's weakness against other currencies should be tackled. He linked this fragility to the country's low reserves. He then compared Nigeria's earnings from its exports to those of the Middle Eastern country of Israel . He claimed that Israel's exports in 2021 were worth $59.8 billion. According to the World Bank, Israel's export earnings in 2021 were far more, at $143 billion . Nigeria's earnings from export in 2019, the year for which the bank last has data, was $63.73 billion . Israel's exports include precious metals and stones, electrical and mechanical machinery, as well as appliances and chemicals. Obi also gave the value of the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam 's exports as being over $350 billion, even though the country has only a fraction of Nigeria's population. Official data shows the country exported $336.31 billion in 2021. Obi's overall argument about Nigeria's need to strengthen exports was made, but he used incorrect figures. Nigeria exports mainly raw materials Nigeria's industries were weak and on their deathbeds, Abayomi Adebayo, a professor of labour and development economics at the Obafemi Awolowo University in the southwestern Nigerian state of Osun, told Africa Check. Adebayo said Nigeria mainly exported raw materials, and earnings from these tended to be lower. \"We should work on how to process what we export to earn more. Refine crude oil for internal use and export to other countries. We must also begin to produce things internally. We are weak in the production of anything. This must change.\" \u2013 Motunrayo Joel The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission by law regulates the country's electricity supply. According to the commission, Nigeria had a total installed capacity of 10,396 megawatts (MW ) in 2017, with available capacity being 6,056 MW. Installed capacity is the maximum theoretical electricity output when power generation operates at 100%. Effective capacity, on the other hand, is the expected output when operating constraints are factored in. In 2018 installed capacity was 12,522MW . In 2022, vice president Yemi Osinbaj o said the country's installed capacity was more than 18,000 MW. We have asked the commission for official data. Without their response, we can for the time being only rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi did not give a timeframe for when oil was 50% of the Nigerian government's revenue . The most recent data on this is from the central bank data , for the second quarter of 2022 \u2013 the months of April, May and June. This shows that non-oil income accounted for 59.5% of revenue, while revenue from oil was 40.5% , a pattern carried over from the previous quarter . \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi added that oil accounts for 80% of the country's foreign exchange revenue. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a monetary authority in foreign currency. They include banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other foreign government securities. According to National Bureau of Statistics data , crude oil accounted for 78.51% of the country's total exports in the third quarter \u2013 July, August and September \u2013 of 2022. 'We need to boost our reserves' The pressure on reserves is enormous, with more going out than coming in. That's what Dr Muda Yusuf , the former director general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry , told Africa Check. He gave \"demand side\" examples of how Nigeria could boost its reserves. They include reducing the import of petroleum products, reviewing the country's industrialisation strategy to make it less dependent on raw material imports, and securing and developing agriculture to cut food imports. On the \"supply side\", Yusuf highlighted the challenge of oil theft, which meant the country was not meeting its targets. The country's foreign exchange policy should also \"be market driven to improve foreign exchange liquidity in the economy\", he said. He added that Nigeria should grow its non-oil exports to add to increased forex inflows. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi claimed that Britain has an unwritten constitution. Is this true? Robert Blackburn, a professor of constitutional law at King's College London , explains this in a 2015 article for the country's national library. It's titled: \" Britain's unwritten constitution \". \"From a comparative perspective, we have what is known as an 'unwritten constitution', although some prefer to describe it as 'uncodified' on the basis that many of our laws of a constitutional nature are in fact written down in Acts of Parliament or law reports of court judgments,\" the article reads. A codified constitution is written down clearly in a specific document, called \"the constitution\" of a country. \"This aspect of the British constitution, its unwritten nature, is its most distinguishing characteristic,\" Blackburn writes. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi was governor of the southeastern state of Anambra over three stints spanning 2006 to 2014. He claimed that when he left office, the share of poor people in Anambra was a low 11.2%. We traced this data to a 2017 paper on poverty by the University of Oxford in the UK. This used several indicators to work out what is known as the multidimensional poverty index . The index reflects the share of possible deprivations that poor people experience. It gives the results as a range, with zero being no poverty and one the highest deprivation. In addition to a national figure, the research found that the share of poor people in Lagos state, the economic hub, was 8.5% , followed by Osun (10.9%) and then Anambra (11.2%). What does more recent data suggest? The 2022 Nigeria Multidimensional Poverty Index survey from Nigeria's national statistics office has a more recent estimate. According to the survey, 133 million Nigerians are multidimensionally poor, with the states of Sokoto, Bayelsa, Gombe, Jigawa and Plateau the poorest. Sokoto leads with 90.5% followed by Bayelsa (88.5%), Gombe (86.2%), Jigawa (84.3%), and Plateau (84%). The least poor states are Ondo (27.2%), Lagos (29.4%), Abia (29.8%), Edo (31%), and Anambra (32.1%). \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Candidate: Kola Abiola , Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) The most recent economic data from the Nigeria statistics bureau that differentiates between the formal and informal sectors is from 2015. It gives the share of the informal sector as 41.43% . In 2017, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the informal sector contributed as much as 65% to Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) - a commonly used measure of an economy's size. A 2021 World Bank database used two methods to estimate Nigeria's informal economy as between 48.2% and 56.2% of the official 2018 GDP. Developing economies 'have bigger informal economies' It was normal for developing economies like Nigeria to have a large informal sector, Oluranti Olurinola, a professor of economics at Covenant University, Ota in southwest Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"The size of the informal sector is usually inversely proportional to development. So, you see that it is developing and emerging nations that have the largest informal sectors,\" Olurinola said. More developed countries, like the OECD countries, have small informal economies because a lot of things are well-structured.\" The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or OECD is an economic grouping of 38 mainly European countries. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Employment in the informal sector may be even more than 84%, Olunrinola said. \"Different studies in different parts of the country show that over 80% of employment is in the informal sector. I recently reviewed one of such studies done by the Nigeria Institute of Social and Economic Research . I am aware it will be published soon,\" he said. In 2021, the World Bank published a paper titled \" The Long Shadow of Informality: Challenges and Policies \". It found that 80.4 % of employment in Nigeria is in the informal sector. Neither the National Bureau of Statistics nor the federal ministry of labour and employment has data on employment in the informal sector. Based on what data is available we rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Allwell Okpi",

        "doc": "South Africa's much-anticipated debate on a motion of no confidence in the president was heavy on rhetoric, but light on claims about President Jacob Zuma's performance. That is except for the second to last speaker, Minister Nathi Mthethwa. The minister of arts and culture listed several government achievements. \"We know very well that their target is not the president alone,\" he said , referring to the opposition. No timeframe mentioned Mthethwa was vague about the time frame he was pegging the achievements to, however. Was he referring to Zuma's term in office or the African National Congress (ANC) party's rule, which commenced in 1994? When Africa Check contacted his spokesman, Lokile Molefe said Mthethwa was speaking in his capacity as an ANC member and that all queries should be directed the party. ANC communications manager, Khusela Sangoni, sent us back to Mthethwa's office. \"All of the information in the speech comes from a report done by the [Human Sciences Research Council] last year,\" Molefe told Africa Check, unable to provide the report's name. Africa Check asked Human Sciences Research Council spokesman Adziliwi Nematandani to help locate the report. But Nematandani was \"still investigating Minister Mthethwa's statements\" by the time we published this report. ( Note: We will update it when he gets back to us .) For the purpose of this fact-check, we assumed that Mthethwa was referring to the ANC's time in government. Claim \"...our people's access to electricity has increased from 58% to 85%.\" Verdict mostly-correct An estimated 50% of South African households had access to electricity in 1994, Africa Check has previously established . By 1996, census figures show it had increased to 58.2%. Statistics South Africa 's most recent general household survey found that 84.2% of households had access to electricity, a slight decrease from the 85.5% reported in 2015. \"Even if the overall decrease of 1.3 percentage points was reported, the absolute numbers for households connected to mains electricity increased by approximately 235,000 households,\" Stats SA's Casment Mahlwele told Africa Check. \"We do not have a statistical reason for the causes of the decrease. However, it might have been as a result of household growth or new settlements which might be informal in nature.\" According to the country's department of energy , \"full electrification is unlikely to be possible due to growth and delays in the process of formalising informal settlements\". Thus providing electricity to 97% of households would constitute universal coverage. When Zuma became president in 2009, access to electricity was at 82.7%. - Ina Skosana Claim \"Government has increased GDP by more than 9 times from R400 billion to over R4 trillion per annum.\" Verdict misleading Without a timeframe to work from, we looked at annual gross domestic product (GDP) data from 1993 to 2016. The data, provided by Stats SA, shows that GDP grew from R438.9 billion in 1993 to R4.3 trillion in 2016. But these figures reflect \"the size of the GDP without taking into account inflation, that is GDP in real terms\", Stats SA's executive manager for national accounts, Michael Manamela, highlighted. When South Africa's GDP is adjusted for inflation, the figures show that it had nearly doubled between 1993 and 2016. \"The relevant measure is real GDP,\" Dr Se\u00e1n Muller, senior lecturer in the faculty of economics and financial sciences at the University of Johannesburg, explained. \"If we used nominal GDP \u2026 we would conclude that rampant inflation was a good thing because it increased GDP. In countries that experience hyperinflation, as Zimbabwe did, real GDP will often plummet even as nominal GDP spikes.\" A further problem Muller identified is that the minister attributed the increase to government. \"While government does play a direct and indirect role in economic growth, the extent of that is a question for more detailed economic analysis,\" he said. \"And a definitive conclusion about the extent to which government (however defined) can be credited with real growth in GDP is rarely (if ever) possible.\" Ideally, population growth should also be factored in, Muller added. - Gopolang Makou Claim \"Life expectancy [has] increased [by] 6 years.\" Verdict downplayed Life expectancy in South Africa stood at 57 years in 1996 based on that year's census. Stats SA's 2017 mid-year population estimates put current life expectancy at 64 years. However, the two years cannot be directly compared as they were \"computed at different points in time when completeness of death registers and data quality were different\", Stats SA's executive manager for demography statistics, Diego Iturralde, told Africa Check. Their current life series commenced in 2002 and shows that life expectancy dipped in the early 2000s - reaching a low of 53.5 years - largely due to the HIV pandemic. It started recovering in 2007 , with Stats SA attributing it to the expansion of HIV treatment as well as the country's prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the virus. When Zuma took office in 2009, life expectancy stood at 56.9 years, working out to an increase of more than 7 years during his term. - Ina Skosana Claim \"Functional illiteracy [has decreased] nearly by half from 34% to 19%.\" Verdict downplayed Statistics South Africa defines \" functional illiteracy \" as the \"percentage of persons aged 20 years and older with no formal education or highest level of education less than grade 7\". Estimates of functional literacy were calculated in 1994, but Ni\u00ebl Roux, manager of service delivery statistics at Stats SA, has previously warned against using them. \"The sample and fieldwork execution used in 1994 were much more rudimentary as a result of the shortage of recent census data,\" explained Roux. \"It is therefore likely that the results of the 1994 survey would be less certain.\" The most reliable data from that time frame comes from the 1996 census. Based on this data, Roux calculated that 35.8% of South Africans were functionally illiterate. By 2016, this had been more than halved to 14.6% of South Africans . - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"\u2026 we have seen students who have obtained the national senior certificate increasing from 45% to 56%\" Verdict unproven Before making this claim, Mthethwa said: \"The basic education system has been [on] an upward trend and [the] matric pass rate has improved.\" The national senior certificate - or matric, as it is commonly called - is the \"certificate awarded as the final exit qualification at the end of Grade 12\" in South Africa. Africa Check couldn't figure out what exactly Mthethwa was speaking about. As his office did not clear it up to us, we have explored three possible meanings below. The country's matric pass rate? No. In 2016, 72.5% of students who wrote the national senior certificate examination passed. In 2008 (the year that the national senior certificate was introduced), 62.6% of students passed. Mthethwa was therefore not referring to the country's matric pass rate - or correctly, in any case. The \"real matric pass rate\"? No. The \"real matric pass rate\" is also known as the \" throughput-pass-rate \". People use it to indicate the share of students who started school in Grade 2 and that went on to pass matric. ( Note: Grade 2 is used for the comparison because many children repeat Grade 1, making the year group abnormally large.) In 2016, 442,672 students wrote and passed their final examination. However, in 2006 - when the students were in Grade 2 - there were 1,054,582 of them. This means that the \"real matric pass rate\" was 42% in 2016. This is lower than both figures cited by Mthethwa. The share of the population holding a national senior certificate? No. Stats SA's 2016 general household survey notes that the share of people older than 20 with at least Grade 12 \"has been increasing consistently since 2002, expanding from 31.4% in 2002 to 42.8% in 2016\". The minister therefore couldn't have been referring to the share of the population that have passed matric, either. We will update this report if Mthethwa's office explains the meaning of this claim. - Kate Wilkinson Claim \"17 million beneficiaries receive social grants\" Verdict mostly-correct In our factsheet on South Africa's social grants, we explained that South Africa's social safety net had increased exponentially since 1994. Back then, government provided four million grants. The latest figures from the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), for July 2017, puts the number of grants at 17,330,034. - Ina Skosana Additional reading : https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-many-motions-no-confidence-sa-president-zuma-faced/",

        "doc": "Nigerians again hit the polling booths on 9 March 2019 , this time to vote in governors and state assemblies. To help inform voters, The City that Works Alliance , a number of professional groups , has in recent weeks organised debates for those who would govern Lagos, the country's commercial nerve centre. (Disclosure: As part of a partnership with the organisers, Africa Check was asked to verify claims made in the debates.) The debates took place in February 2019, one for deputy governor candidates and the other for governor candidates. Seven parties took part, providing 10 candidates. Only three - the Labour Party , the National Conscience Party and the Young Progressives Party were in both debates. Other parties seeking to run the city are Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party , Mega Party of Nigeria , Africa Action Congress and the All Progressives Congress . But did they all get their facts straight? We looked at several claims. The economy Claim \"Lagos is the economic hub of Nigeria. Its economy is among the top two or three in Africa.\" Verdict unproven Who: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience Party Gross domestic product is a measure of the size of a country's economy. It can also be used for smaller regions such as cities and states . Awe told Africa Check he was comparing Lagos's economy with that of other African cities. He added that for GDP, Lagos was only comparable to Johannesburg and Cairo. The most recent data on Lagos's GDP is from a survey done from December 2011 to April 2012. It found that the state's GDP was US$80 billion in 2010, which it said made it the fourth biggest city economy in sub-Saharan Africa after Cairo, Johannesburg and Cape Town. But in 2014 Nigeria reviewed its economy to better count sectors such as telecoms and the movie industry. This saw national GDP nearly double, from $270 billion to $510 billion. READ: What do Nigeria's new GDP numbers really mean? But the survey took its African cities data from Wikipedia, which notes that comparisons are difficult as data is collected in different ways. Without more reliable and newer data we can't prove or disprove this claim. (Note: We have contacted the state for when it will have newer GDP data). Claim \"Lagos contributes significantly to Nigeria's GDP.\" Verdict correct Who: Adesina Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Young Progressives Party The statistics bureau 's latest data shows that Nigeria's nominal GDP was N127.76 trillion in 2018. But it doesn't break this down by states. GDP data for Lagos, one of 36 states, is only available for 2010, when its output of N12.09 trillion made up 35.6% of the national total. Claim \"Multiple taxation is real in Lagos but, statistically, less than 10% of the population of Lagos pay tax.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience Party The most recent publicly available official figures on taxpayers in Lagos state is from 2016. The tax report from the Lagos Internal Revenue Service put the state's total number of taxpayers at 4.9 million . In 2016 the population of Lagos was estimated at 12.6 million by the National Bureau of Statistics . But population numbers in Nigeria are highly contested - a state governor is on record saying the population is more than 24 million. The state also gives its population as 24.6 million in 2015. For taxpayers to be only 10% of the population, Lagos would need about 50 million people. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. Claim \"About 60% of taxes in Lagos is paid by civil servants.\" Verdict unproven Who: Prof Ifagbemi Awamaridi, governor candidate, Labour Party State authorities have estimated Lagos's taxpayers at 4.9 million in 2016 and 5.3 million in 2017. The state deducts tax from civil servants' salaries at source, but we couldn't find verified data on the share of taxes paid by public workers. Taiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC Nigeria , said civil servants could pay up to 60% of Lagos taxes. \"The figure is up to that. However, I can't lay my hands on data to back it up,\" he told Africa Check. Claim \"The APC government has taken the state's monthly internally generated revenue from N600 million in 1999 to N33 billion.\" Verdict correct Who: Obafemi Hamzat, deputy governor candidate, All Progressives Congress In 1999, under former governor Bola Tinubu, Lagos generated monthly revenue of N600 million, according to the World Bank. In May 2018 the state's top financial officer said Lagos was generating about N34 billion a month in own revenue. Claim \"People say the internally generated revenue is high, but the budget of Lagos state is less than $3 billion.\" Verdict mostly-correct Who: Obafemi Hamzat Hamzat, who has headed the state's infrastructure and science dockets, said Lagos's budget was too low for its needs. Does Nigeria's commercial capital operate on less than $3 billion? The 2019 budget is yet to be law, but the 2018 budget was N1.046 trillion , or $3.42 billion at the official rate of N306 to a dollar. However, the state's budget was $2.2 billion in 2016 ; $2.7 billion in 2017 and $2.8 billion proposed for 2019 \u2013 all less than $3 billion. On the balance of this trend we find this claim mostly correct. Claim \"[Lagos's budget] is what the city of New York uses to fight fire.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Obafemi Hamzat Hamzat said the state's budget was equivalent to that of New York city's fire department. New York's 2018 budget was $84.9 billion , with $2.04 billion going to the fire department . Lagos's 2018 budget was $3.42 billion , so the candidate was off the mark by about $1.38 billion. Claim \"The budget of the New York police department is twice that of Lagos State.\" Verdict exaggerated Who: Obafemi Hamzat The New York Police Department 's approved budget for 2018 was $5.57 billion. Lagos's 2018 budget was N1.046 trillion , or $3.42 billion at the official rate of N306 to a dollar. This is not half the budget of the NYPD. Hamzat would have been more on the mark in 2017, when Lagos's budget was N812.99 billion ($2.7 billion), half what New York police spent - $5.58 billion . Claim \"About 56% of VAT collection in this country comes from Lagos.\" Verdict unproven Who: Obafemi Hamzat In 2018 national collection of value added tax was N1.103 trillion , from N972.3 billion in 2017. Recent comparable full data for Lagos is however incomplete: From January to June 2018 it collected N8.03 billion , and N6.38 billion for the first six months of 2017. But while Lagos accounts for \"most consumption\" VAT receipts are \"confidential\", Federal Inland Revenue Service spokesperson Wahab Gbadamosi told Africa Check. \"I may not be able to give you figures that say either 50 or 90% of VAT, those documents are confidential, I don't have the figure that more than 56% of VAT comes from Lagos.\" In the absence of this information we rate this claim unproven. Claim \"\u2026and then we (Lagos) don't get it back.\" Verdict misleading Who: Obafemi Hamzat Again using the example of New York, Hamzat said the US city was able to do more for its residents as it kept a large chunk of the sales tax it collected. The federation account allocation report released by the National Bureau of Statistics in December 2018 shows how the central government shared the month's revenue. Lagos got N8.23 billion, or 59.4%, of the N13.85 billion it generated in VAT that month. Population Claim \"The population of Lagos is unknown.\" Verdict correct Who: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience Party Lagos's population has been a source of controversy since the disputed 2006 national census \u2013 Nigeria's most recent. That count put the population of Lagos at 9 million. The state government rejected this , claiming the correct number was 17.5 million. On its website the state gives the population as 24.6 million in 2015. However, the National Bureau of Statistics estimated Lagos's population at 12.6 million in 2016. Health Claim \"Presently, we don't have primary healthcare centres in Lagos.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Oluwasegun Musa, governor candidate, Advanced Nigeria Democratic party Musa likened the primary healthcare centres in Lagos to immunisation centres. There are five types of health institution in Nigeria,  according to the National Primary Health Care Development Agency . The agency lists the minimum requirements of each. Those classified as primary health centres - which must cover at least 10 voting wards, serving 10,000 to 20,000 people in a local government - 288 meet the requirements in Lagos. They offer more than routine immunisation. Education Claim \"What Lagos is using to service debt is higher than what it devotes to education.\" Verdict exaggerated In 2017 Lagos spent N30.9 billion servicing its total debt of N874.38 billion . The budget for education that year was N92.44 billion . In 2016 the state spent N13.2 billion on its debt of N603.25 billion and allocated N113.379 billion to education. Claim \"The recommended percentage of the budget that should go to education according to the United Nations is 26%.\" Verdict unproven Who: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience Party Awe said successive governments had not adequately funded education. Lagos allocated less than the share the UN recommended for education, which he said was 26% of the state's annual budget. The claim that countries should attribute 26% of their budget to education is popular in Nigeria and often attributed to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization . But we could find no evidence of it. The UN agency does have a \"recommended\" 15% to 20% of the annual budget, but this is for countries, not states. Claim \"Local governments by law are supposed to take care of primary schools across the country.\" Verdict correct Who: Obafemi Hamzat, deputy governor candidate, All Progressives Congress Lagos state government taking on the responsibilities of local governments was also discussed. Hamzat said local governments should ideally run primary education, but state governments took over when local governments failed to pay teachers' salaries. Nigeria's constitution clearly states that local governments are responsible for \"the provision and maintenance of primary, adult and vocational education\". Infrastructure Claim \" All public infrastructure in the state from that time complied with the [Lagos State Special Peoples] act.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Obafemi Hamzat The Lagos State Special Peoples Bill was passed by the state in August 2010, becoming law in June 2011 . It requires public institutions to be accessible to people living with disabilities. But there are gaps in the implementation of the law, David Anyaele, executive director of Centre for Citizen with Disabilities , told Africa Check. A 2018 study by the organisation found enforcement \"has been very weak\" and a number of state facilities were \"largely inaccessible\", Anyaele said. Claim \"We are the only sub-sovereign in the world that is funding a rail longer than 7 kilometres from its balance sheet; it never happens anywhere in the world.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Obafemi Hamzat We find this claim inaccurate. Lagos is funding such a project from its resources, but external funds have also been used. The Lagos Urban Rail Network of urban rail lines is expected to cover seven high-demand corridors of the state, at an estimated cost of $135 million. But commercial loans, concessions and bonds have been added to the state's funding, according to two former state governors. They include a N160 billion loan from the World Bank. The city of Beijing and the northern Indian city of Uttar Pradesh have also used this financing model. Claim \" Amsterdam is a city below sea level, like Lagos, but it does not suffer flooding like Lagos.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Olufunso Awe, governor candidate, National Conscience Party While parts of Lagos could be affected by a rise in sea level, no part of the city is below sea level. Nigeria is not on a list of 33 countries in the world with land below sea level. The Netherlands is listed . A topographic map shows nearly half the country lies below sea level, including parts of Amsterdam. The country is said to have one of the world's best flood control systems but still experiences occasional flooding . Services Claim \"Clearing the rubbish [waste] you see on the road is the responsibility of the local governments.\" Verdict correct Who: Olayemi Oladapo, deputy governor candidate, African Action Congress Nigeria has 774 local governments spread across the 36 states and Federal Capital Territory. Lagos has 20 local governments. Nigeria's constitution spells out the functions of a local government. These include \"the provision and maintenance of public conveniences, sewage and refuse disposal\". Governance Claim \"The freedom of information act has not been domesticated in Lagos. \" Verdict misleading Who:  Adesina Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Young Progressives Party Lagos state was not open about its operations, many debaters said. Nigeria's freedom of information act was signed into law in 2011. Lagos often knocks back requests for information under this law. But in 2017 a court ruled that the law does apply to the state, where it does not require \"domestication\" to take effect. The ruling has been upheld by higher courts, but information from the state is still hard to come by. The st ate government's books remain largely closed to the public. We rate this claim misleading as the existing court ruling ends the argument on domestication of the law. Gender equality Claim \"YPP is the only party in Lagos with a woman as its governorship candidate.\" Verdict incorrect Who: Adesina Ibrahim, deputy governor candidate, Young Progressives Party Apart from the YPP, six other parties have women as their candidates for Lagos governor. These are the Africa Peoples Alliance , Allied Peoples Movement , Progressive Peoples Alliance , Providence People's Congress and People's Trust . Sports Claim \"Lagos state does not have a football team.\" Verdict correct Who: Alawuye Ibrahim, deputy  governor candidate, Labour Party While other states own football clubs, \"it's surprising and very bad\" that Lagos doesn't, Ibrahim said. The state doesn't own a football club in any known league, according to the Lagos State Sports Commission . It does allow private clubs to use its facilities, Abimbola Awoyele, a sports journalist, told Africa Check. It also funds some clubs.

        "doc": "With President Muhammadu Buhari away on indefinite medical leave , acting-president Yemi Osinbajo gave Nigeria's 2017 Democracy Day speech . The annual speech on 29 May is regarded as the country's informal state of the nation address. (Note: A parliamentary bill to compel presidents to periodically address Nigerians on the state of the nation was vetoed by former President Goodluck Jonathan.) In his speech, Osinbajo gave an account of the government's efforts over the past 2 years in delivering on promises made to Nigerians. \"We also know that this journey will of necessity take time,\" he told Nigerians in a national broadcast . \"But we will not succumb to the temptation to take short-cuts that ultimately complicate the journey. We did not find ourselves in crises overnight, and we simply do not expect overnight solutions to our challenges.\" We zeroed in on 3 claims Osinbajo made about an increase in sovereign savings, a drop in rice imports and the size of infrastructure spend. Claim \"We have in the last 2 years added US$500 million to our sovereign wealth fund.\" Verdict unproven The acting president said efforts by the All Progressive Congress-led government in curbing corruption and plugging leakages have saved the country billions of naira to save for a rainy day. \"We have taken very seriously our promise to save and invest for the future, even against the backdrop of our revenue challenges, and we have in the last two years added US$500 million to our sovereign wealth fund,\" he said in the broadcast. Nigeria's sovereign wealth fund was set up in 2012 to save and manage excess money Nigeria makes from the selling crude oil. It is managed by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and comprises 3 separate funds: the Nigeria infrastructure fund (40%), future generations fund (40%) and the stabilisation fund (20%). At the end of 2015, the fund's balance was N214 billion. The 2016 financial statement - released in April 2017 - shows that the fund's balance had more than doubled to N420 billion (roughly US$1.37 billion using the current Central Bank exchange rate of N305.4/$). Part of the increase was due to an allocation of US$250 million (about N76.3 billion) by the present administration, which reflected in February 2016. In February 2017, another US$250 million was reportedly added to the fund. However, an insider claimed it was drawn from the excess crude account, another government savings fund. ( Note: The excess crude account was created in 2004 to help fund subsequent budget deficits and shield the country's economy from external shocks .) We asked the office of the acting p resident for proof of the payments but Laolu Akande, Osinbajo's media liaison, is yet to get back to us. Claim \"I am delighted to note that since 2015 our imports of rice have dropped by 90%.\" Verdict incorrect Nigeria consumes more rice than any African country and is one of the biggest producers and importers of the grain on the continent, according to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation. In 2015, the Nigerian government introduced a borrowing programme to stimulate local rice production while reducing the country's food import bills. To help achieve this, the Central Bank of Nigeria imposed import restrictions on rice. Still, none of the 3 international databases Africa Check consulted showed that the programme or import restrictions had an effect of significantly lowering rice imports. The 2016 Rice Market Monitor of the Food and Agriculture Organisation states that rice imports increased from 2.2 million tonnes in 2015 to an estimated 2.5 million tonnes of rice in 2016. Data from the International Grain Council reveals that rice imports in 2016 were estimated to be the same as in 2015, at 2.1 million tonnes. In its 2017 Global Agricultural Information Network report, the United States department of agriculture 's statistics show that imports dropped slightly between 2015 and 2016: from 2.1 million tonnes of the grain to 2 million tonnes. ( Note: This department's reporting year runs from October to September.) Our queries to the department of agriculture for data to support the acting president's claim went unanswered. Claim \"In the 2016 budget, we spent N1.2 trillion on infrastructure projects.\" Verdict unproven To stimulate economic recovery, the acting president said the Nigerian government would continue to spend on infrastructure, claiming that the large spend in 2016 marked \"another milestone in the history of this country\". In May, the Federal Ministry of Finance published a media releases detailing how the 2016 infrastructure budget was spent . Sector Spend Power, works & housing N307,411,749,682 Defence and security N171,900,597,013 Transport & aviation N143,121,925,241 Total N622,434,271,936 This adds up to half of the funds budgeted for infrastructure, with spending on agriculture, water resources, education and health projects taking the total to 62%. Due to the late passage of the 2016 budget, two-thirds of it is yet to be spent (N4 trillion of N6.06 trillion), Moses Tule, the director of monetary policy at the Central Bank of Nigeria said in an interview in May 2017. In Nigeria, there is a clear difference between what was budgeted for something, what was eventually spent on it and if it was achieved, Adetokunbo Mumuni, the executive director of the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project , a non-governmental organisation that focuses on anti-corruption, economic and social rights, told Africa Check . \"The next question for the acting president is to give a breakdown of what infrastructure has that money been spent on so that we can now do a follow up as to where those infrastructure [projects] are. It is not sufficient that such claim be made.\" Additional reading https://africacheck.org/reports/buhari-apcs-campaign-promises-appraising-9-pledges-2-years/",

        "doc": "This week, Nigerians will elect a president. They are spoilt for choice: the official list has 73 names for the presidency, though some have since dropped out or endorsed others . The ruling All Progressives Congress and opposition Peoples Democratic Party are seen as the parties to beat. In recent town hall meetings their presidential flagbearers, the APC's President Muhammadu Buhari and PDP's Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president, laid out their plans to improve Nigeria. But did they get their facts right? We checked eight notable claims. We have contacted both campaigns for their evidence and will update this report should they respond. (Note: We've also fact-checked claims by other candidates from other parties. You can also keep track of the progress of campaign pledges made by the incumbent administration by visiting our Nigeria promise tracker .) PARTY : ALL PROGRESSIVES CONGRESS Who: President Muhammadu Buhari Claim \"The question of Almajiris' lack of primary or basic education are all local government problems.\" Verdict mostly-correct The basic education of \"Almajiris\" - poor children in northern Nigeria - is mainly the responsibility of local governments and not the \"centre\", Buhari said at a January 2019 town hall meeting. The Universal Basic Education Act provides for free basic education for all Nigerian children of school-going age. The act gives the federal government a mainly oversight role. Providing and maintaining primary education is a function of local government councils, according to the country's constitution. \"While the president is right that local governments are constitutionally charged to provide basic education, his constitutional oversight roles allows him to implement direct intervention schemes if needed,\" Eduplana 's Oriyomi Ogunwale told Africa Check. The organisation monitors education standards in Nigeria. Claim \"When this administration came in, Boko Haram was holding 17 local governments in the northeast... they are not holding any local government now.\" Verdict unproven Buhari was answering a question on why Boko Haram militants were still active when his administration had claimed they were \"technically defeated\". (Note: Africa Check has previously checked a number of claims that the group has been vanquished). The number of local government areas under the militants' control in 2015 has been variously reported, from 14 to \"around\" 20. Recent Boko Haram actions include the February 2019 attacks in the states of Adamawa and Maiduguri and the November 2018 loss of 23 soldiers in Metele, Borno. Despite these setbacks, the group certainly did not hold broad swathes of territory, Adebayo Akinade, the director-general of the Institute of Security Nigeria , told Africa Check. There had been \"a larger measure of success in driving away Boko Haram\", he said. \"I know they are still a threat because they have some international backing. But there's been a drastic improvement.\" Cheta Nwanze, lead researcher at SBM Intelligence , however told Africa Check he believed the group still held some areas in the north. It is difficult to independently verify that Boko Haram does not retain a hold on any area, which is why we rate this claim as still unproven. - David Ajikobi Who: Yemi Osinbajo (VP and Buhari's running mate) Claim \"Nigeria earned US$383 billion from oil revenues in the four years preceding our government [but] there were no savings.\" Verdict incorrect Osinbajo said the previous PDP government had enjoyed high oil revenues, but failed to save any of it. He estimated the country's oil earnings from 2011 to 2014 at US$383 billion. Annual data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation shows that in that period the country exported 3.2 billion barrels of crude oil. The Nigerian Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative is the best source of data for government revenue from oil and gas, chartered accountant Haruna Yahaya told Africa Check. Yahaya's accountancy firm audits companies in the oil and gas sector and works with the extractive initiative to produce annual reports. The reports show that the Nigerian government earned $68.44 billion in 2011, $62.94 billion in 2012, $58.08 billion in 2013 and $54.56 billion in 2014. This was $244 billion over the four years, significantly lower than Osinbajo's claim. Were there 'no savings' at all? This is also incorrect. Nigeria had $28.34 billion in foreign reserves and $2 billion in its excess crude account in June 2015, days after Buhari took power, according to the finance ministry. Oil revenue that exceeds a threshold set by the budget is saved in the excess crude account. It is a buffer against revenue shortfalls and changing oil prices. - Allwell Okp i Claim \" Every country in the world that wants to undergo serious development borrows money. Our debt-to-GDP ratio of about 20% is one of the lowest in the world. \" Verdict downplayed The vice president was batting away the moderator's claim that the current administration had contracted more debt than the economy could afford. Nigeria was borrowing to build infrastructure and the country's debt-to-GDP of \"about 20% is one of the lowest in the world,\" Osinbajo said . The International Monetary Fund projects Nigeria's 2019 gross debt-to-GDP ratio at 26.85% . It was 24.76% in 2018. Some 19 countries have a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than Nigeria. While Nigeria's debt-to-GDP ratio can be considered low relative to other countries, a more important factor is the debt service to revenue ratio, Ifeanyi Nwokoma, professor of economics at the University of Lagos , told Africa Check. \"Low debt-to-GDP ratio is not a guarantee [you can] borrow more. In terms of specifics, you need to go deeper and look at your ability to service the debt.\" In a March 2018 report, Nigeria's Debt Management Office said both its public and external debt service ratios were \"highly\" vulnerable to reduced government revenue. Osinbajo did concede that there was \"a revenue to debt issue\" and that the country should be earning more revenue than it currently does. His claim thus understates this fact. - Allwell Okpi PARTY: PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC PARTY Who: PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar Claim \"We have 21 million unemployed young men and women.\" Verdict downplayed Abubakar made a similar claim when flagging off his presidential campaign in July 2018. The National Bureau of Statistics defines the \"youth\" in the job market as people aged 15 to 34. The bureau's most recent data shows that as at September 2018, 55.4% of young people were either underemployed or unemployed, an increase from 52.6% in the same period of 2017. In absolute terms, 13.1 million young people were unemployed while 11.3 million were underemployed, working less than 20 hours a week. This adds up to 24.5 million, up from the 22.64 million recorded between January and September 2017. Abubakar's number is thus lower than what the data shows. \u2013 David Ajikobi Claim \"...We have not had it so bad in this country.\" Verdict unproven Abubakar added that this level of unemployment was unprecedented in Nigeria. While the claim could be correct in terms of absolute numbers, comparing historical unemployment rates in Nigeria would be wrong, Sarah Anyanwu, a professor of development economics at the University of Abuja previously told Africa Check. This is because the country had since changed the way it calculated unemployment. (Note: A detailed explanation can be read here .) Anyawu chaired the committee that reviewed unemployment statistics in 2014. - David Ajikobi Who: PDP vice presidential candidate Peter Obi Claim \"Capital expenditure in 2016 was N1.2 trillion and 2017 was N1.5 trillion.\" Verdict unproven Obi prefaced the claim by saying that while the government borrowed N7.428 trillion for public projects in 2015 and 2017, only N3.2 trillion was used for this purpose. According to the Debt Management Office , Nigeria's total debt was N12.6 trillion in December 2015, N17.36 trillion in December 2016 and N21.73 trillion in December 2017. In 2016, capital expenditure was N1.59 trillion (including share of capital in statutory transfers was N1.75 trillion ). But media reports say the amount disbursed for capital projects that year was N1.2 trillion . We have not yet been able to verify this figure as some of this rolled over into 2017. In 2017, the budgeted capital expenditure was N2,178 trillion , while development projects for the year were reported in the media as using N1.6 trillion. But in the absence of an official budget performance report, we are unable to verify Obi's number. - Motunrayo Joel Claim \"We now have 90 million people living in extreme poverty.\" Verdict mostly-correct According to the World Poverty Clock , Nigeria had an estimated 87 million people living in extreme poverty in May 2018 \u2013 more than India's 73 million - and the highest in the world. The clock is run by the World Data Lab and defines extreme poverty as living on less than US$1.90 a day. In January 2019, when Obi made the claim , the clock's estimate was 90.9 million extremely poor Nigerians or close to half of the country's estimated population of 195.7 million. World Data Lab's Kristofer Hamel told Africa Check the clock uses different data sources. For Nigeria it used four: the 2012/2013 General Household Survey, national accounts published by the World Bank, IMF GDP per capita growth rates, and population data. Its research methods have been peer-reviewed . But Polycarp Chigbu , a professor of statistics at the University of Nigeria Nsukka , told Africa Check he had concerns about the age of the data. \"The reliability of data is largely dependent on when and how it was collected. 2013 is a long time ago. A lot of economic indicators may have changed.\" He added that shorter-term data may not track economic cycles too well. -Allwell Okpi Further reading : https://africacheck.org/reports/checked-two-claims-about-the-astronomical-cost-of-nigerias-election/ https://africacheck.org/reports/nigeria-debate2019-did-presidential-candidates-get-their-facts-straight/",

The election race in Lagos state, the economic hub of Africa's wealthiest and most populated country, is being keenly watched. In a debate in late January, three of the Lagos governorship candidates debated issues such as education, housing, transport, healthcare and water supply. The moderator also chimed in with claims of his own. We check 18 of the claims made during the debate. Some are correct and some mostly correct, but more are either incorrect or unproven. Lagos is Nigeria's economic hub , so the race to govern the state is closely watched. Nigerians are set to pick a president and members of the national assembly on 25 February 2023 . Two weeks later, on 11 March, they'll vote for state assemblies and the governors of 28 states, including Lagos. The country has 36 states, plus the federal capital territory of Abuja. On 29 January three of the frontrunners in the Lagos governorship race took part in a debate organised by the Platform Nigeria , a nonprofit that organises events and conversations around national development. The debate was moderated by Dr Victor Oladokun, a veteran broadcaster. The three were Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Labour Party , Abdul-Azeez Adediran of the Peoples Democratic Party and Funso Doherty of the African Democratic Congress . Incumbent Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) opted out on the eve of the debate. The three candidates answered questions about their plans for education, healthcare, poverty, crime, transport, the youth and more. We fact-checked 18 claims the candidates, and the moderator, made during the debate. The candidates: a brief profile Funso Doherty , 55, has a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Lagos and an MBA from Harvard University in the US. He has experience working for financial consulting firms in Nigeria and the US and has been a chief executive officer of three pension funds and investment firms. Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour , 39, has a bachelor's degree in architecture from Nottingham University and a master's degree from the US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also in architecture. He also has a master's in research and public policy from the University of Lagos. He runs his own architectural firm. Abdul-Azeez Adediran , 45, is an experienced broadcast journalist. He owns a media company and is a philanthropist through his Jandor Foundation. He has an honorary doctorate in leadership and governance from South America University in Lagos. Candidate: Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour Labour Party Criticising transport infrastructure in Lagos, Rhodes-Vivour claimed that the state government had built only 16 kilometres of rail in 14 years. He was referring to the first phase of the Lagos rail mass transit blue line , which president Muhammadu Buhari launched a few days before the debate. The line is one of six in the Lagos transport master plan . When complete, it should be 27 kilometres long. But the first phase is 13 km long , not 16 km. Rhodes-Vivour also overstated the construction time. A Chinese company started work in July 2010 and completed the first phase in December 2022 . So construction took about 12 years and six months, not 14 years. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Rhodes-Vivour also blamed constant flooding in Lagos on the state government's mismanagement of wetlands. He claimed the state did not have a policy to protect wetlands. Wetlands are ecosystems where water is the main factor controlling the environment. They include lakes, rivers, swamps and coral groves. Nigeria is a signatory to a UN treaty on the conservation and use of wetlands. There is evidence that the state government has drafted a wetlands policy . But this has not been made law . In March 2022 Tunji Bello, the state's environment commissioner, said the policy was still being reviewed. It is therefore not in force. \u2013 Allwell Okpi The claim that 2 million children in Lagos don't attend school was frequently repeated during the debate. Oladokun , the moderator, and the candidates Rhodes-Vivour and Abdul-Azeez Adediran all said it. State officials have also made the claim. But is this true? Not according to the available data. The most recent estimate by Unesco , the UN's education and culture agency, is that 20 million children across Nigeria are out of school. The data comes from t he federal ministry of education , the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and others. So if Lagos, one of 36 states, has 2 million out-of-school children, it would account for 10% of the national total. This was not possible, Oriyomi Ogunwale told Africa Check. He is the project lead at Eduplana , a Nigerian organisation that focuses on education. \"Lagos is not among the states with the highest number of out-of-school children in the country. Even northern states like Bauchi, Sokoto, Kano, or Kebbi with some of the highest rates do not have up to 2 million.\" Politicians often trotted out unsupported numbers, Ogunwale said. But part of the problem was that Lagos state rarely published data. \"It is not easy to look up Lagos state data on education and other areas.\" Lagos one of four states with lowest out-of-school rates In late 2022, the NBS published its first multidimensional poverty index . This found that 28.7% of children aged six to 15 were out of school, across Nigeria. This is about 16.2 million children, based on the estimate of 56.3 million children in that age range. The northern state of Kebbi had the highest rate of out-of school children, at 67.6% . It was followed by Sokoto (66.4%), Yobe (62.9%) and Zamfara at 61.3%. At 6.4% , Lagos had one of the lowest rates. Only three other states, also in the south, had lower: Anambra (2.9%), Imo (5.1%) and Abia (5.6%). The survey put the number of school-age children that are out of school in Lagos at 200,000 , or about 10% of the claimed figure. Also, data put out in 2018 by the Universal Basic Education Commission gave the figure for out-of-school children in Lagos as 254,654 . This is still the agency's most recent published data. \u2013 Allwell Okpi The Lagos public school system was failing, Rhodes-Vivour said during the debate . As evidence, he claimed only 14% of the state's pupils were in public primary schools. The 2019 federal education ministry's Nigeria digest of education statistics puts the number of primary school pupils in Lagos at 885,045 . Of these, 405,316 were in public schools and 479,729 in private schools. But the digest adds that the figure for private schools was from as far back as 2016, so it could now be significantly more. Working with the available figures, the share of pupils in public schools comes to 45.8%, three times higher than Rhodes-Vivour claimed. The Lagos state annual school census report for 2019 gives a slightly lower figure of 402,770 public primary schools in the state, but does not give a figure for private schools. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Rhodes-Vivour also said that only 25% of secondary school students were in public schools. The 2019 education digest breaks down the data for secondary schools into junior and senior secondary. Lagos had 543,242 students in junior secondary schools in 2019. Of these 372,883 , or 68.64%, were in public schools. In the same year there were 394,884 students in senior secondary. Of these, 242,255 or 61.35% attended public schools, while the rest were in private schools. The Lagos school census has lower numbers \u2013 372,295 students in public junior secondary and 234,611 in public senior secondary. Despite the disparity between the Lagos census and national data, the evidence is that significantly more than 25% of the state's secondary school students attend public schools. \u2013 Allwell Okpi . Candidate: Abdul-Azeez Adediran Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) The most recent data from the 2019 Nigeria digest of education statistics puts the total number of teachers in Lagos state at 177,558. Of those, 60,216 were primary school teachers, 51,902 junior secondary school teachers and 65,440 secondary school teachers. To mark world teachers' day in October 2020, Buhari announced improved terms for teachers. Eight months later the president asked the national assembly to raise teachers' retirement age from 60 to 65 years. This was approved and became national law in April 2022. But does the law apply in Lagos? The new retirement age or years of service was yet to be implemented in the state, Akintoye Hassan, t he chairperson of the Nigerian Union of Teachers in Lagos, told Africa Check. \"We are yet to have the implementation of the 65 years in Lagos state,\" he said. \"The union is still making efforts to make the government pronounce the approval of it so urgently before the election.\" \u2013 Catherine Adeniyi After the new terms for teachers became national law, the federal government asked states to implement them. Borno , Kebbi and Ondo are among the states reported to have done so. Adediran claimed Lagos was the only state in Nigeria that hadn't. Teachers' union chair Hassan told Africa Check that Lagos was not the only state yet to put the new terms in place. He added that an analysis was needed to find out how many other states hadn't yet done so. Africa Check was also unable to independently verify the claim at the time of publishing this report. Until we do, we will rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Catherine Adeniyi Adediran made this claim while outlining how he would, if elected, make sure all children attended school. According to the 2019 Nigeria digest of education statistics , Lagos state has 13,633 private schools. Of these, 12,373 are in urban areas and 1,260 are rural. But in 2019 state education commissioner Folashade Adefisayo reportedly said there were 18,573 private schools in Lagos. Adefisayo is also on record as saying in May 2021 that only a quarter of the roughly 20,000 private schools in Lagos were registered with the state. We have asked the state why the numbers at national and state level differ so much, but are yet to receive a reply. Despite this, there are certainly more than 5,000 private schools in Lagos. \u2013 Catherine Adeniyi Candidate: Funso Doherty Action Democratic Congress (ADC) Doherty said if he were elected his administration would review Lagos's education curriculum so as to produce more skilled workers. He claimed that only 10,000, or 1%, of the state's 1 million public school students attended technical schools. These schools train students to become technicians: mechanics, electricians, welders, plumbers, caterers, and graphic designers. A student has to have completed junior secondary to be admitted to a public technical school in Lagos. The Lagos state schools census 2018/19 is the most recent data on the state's website. It shows there were 1,082,634 students in its public schools, of which 7,825 , or 0.72%, were in technical schools. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Nigeria's youthful population was an advantage for Lagos state in areas such as sports, Doherty said . He then claimed the median age in Nigeria was \" about 17 \". The median age is the midpoint of a population's age range. The number of people older than the median age is equal to the number of people who are younger. The UN department of economic and social affairs population division gives Nigeria's media age as 17.1 in 2022 , and expected to inch up to 17.2 in 2023. In 1990, the country's median age was 16.4 .\u2013 Allwell Okpi Claims by the moderator: Dr Victor Oladokun Moderator Victor Oladokun also made a few claims, most of them unproven. ( See how we define this and other verdicts .) One of his more checkable claims was about health staffing. \"According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there are 2,561 registered doctors in Lagos,\" he said . The bureau 's most recent data, published in August 2021, did estimate this number for 2019. Of these, 1,490 were male and 1,071 female. The Lagos doctor brain drain But the data leaves out the issue of brain drain. There were 7,343 registered doctors in Lagos state in 2017, and 8,276 in 2018. Dr Benjamin Olowojebutu, the chair of the Lagos chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association said in December 2022 that 507 of the state's doctors had migrated to the UK from March 2020 to October 2022. In December 2022 alone, Olowojebutu said , Lagos state lost more than 1,800 doctors and other healthcare workers to brain drain. These exits meant the NBS estimate should not be taken as being the same today, Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at the bureau, told Africa Check. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Africa Check has fact-checked several claims about a doctor-to-patient ratio supposedly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). But the WHO has said it does not prescribe any ideal ratio \"because there isn't a simple answer or one-size-fits-all solution\" . \"All health systems are different: different organisations, different financial systems, different organisations of the workforce. What could work in one country would not in another,\" a WHO expert previously told us. The WHO only says countries with fewer than 10 doctors \u2013 and 40 nurses and midwives \u2013 for every 10,000 people do not have enough healthcare professionals. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Oladokun claimed that there were 23 million people living in Lagos. If this were true, his claim would be correct. But the state's population is highly controversial . Nigeria's last census, in 2006, estimated there were 9 million Lagosians. In data published on its website in 2015 , which remains up, the state government gave the population as 24.6 million. Just a year later, the NBS estimated the state's population at 12.6 million . \u2013 Motunrayo Joel As noted in the previous two claims, and working with Oladokun's population estimate and the NBS's registered doctor estimate of 2,561, the ratio is 1:8,980 \u2013 nine times \u2013 what the WHO is claimed to have recommended. But with weak data on state and doctor population, and a nonexistent WHO recommendation, the claim is unproven. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Oladokun claimed that only a 10th of Lagos's 23 million people have access to pipe-borne water. Pipe-borne water is potable water free of contamination, particularly by faeces. To check this claim, we consulted the 2021 water, sanitation and hygiene national outcome routine mapping survey, or Wash-Norm . This is an annual survey by the federal water ministry, done in partnership with the NBS and the UN's children agency, Unicef . The 2021 Wash-Norm survey is the third in the series, after the 2018 and 2019 editions. Published in June 2022, it covers 13,376,240 households in Lagos. It found that only 5.3% of the state's population has access to pipe-borne water. Another data source is the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey . After assessing 12,588 households from September 2021 to December 2021, the survey estimated that 5% of people in Lagos have access to pipe-borne water. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel We traced this claim to a December 2022 report in the Guardian , a Nigerian newspaper. It claims that the state has a population of about 25 million, and that 60% of its young people are aged 15 to 35. This works out at 10 million young people, not 13 million. The state's most recent demographic report is from 2015 . This gave the state's population as 23 million, nearly two thirds ( 64% ) of them aged 15 to 59. This translates to 14.7 million people. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel The Lagos State Residents' Registration Agency would have this data.  We have asked the agency for this information but are yet to hear back. We will update this report with their response. There have been several estimates in the media, including this blog which appears to be the source of the claim's 1.49 million figure . But without data we can independently verify, we rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel The blog also claims Lagos state has a deficit of 3.2 million housing units. But in the absence of data we also rate this claim as unproven. A major issue with housing in Lagos was the lack of data on the number of housing units the state needed, Eziyi Ibem , the head of the University of Nigeria 's architecture department, told Africa Check. \"All the data being published in the news media and academic papers are based on estimations. As a result, it is difficult to know the exact housing supply deficit in Lagos,\" he said. \"The best approach to knowing the right housing stock is to carry out an accurate housing census in Lagos. I hope the upcoming national census can help in achieving this.\" Ibem said developing housing standards for low-income people would help solve the state's housing crisis. \"Based on this housing standard, religious organisations, philanthropic organisations and housing cooperatives would be encouraged to invest heavily in social housing programmes for the poor and low-income earners in the city. \"This can succeed with support from the government in the provision of land and housing infrastructure.\" \u2013 Motunrayo Joel",

        "doc": "On 16 February 2021 members of South Africa's parliament started to debate president Cyril Ramaphosa's state of the nation address, delivered five days before. We examine five claims made in the debate, covering gender-based violence, education, renewable energy, the economy and municipal functionality. A claim about a drop in gender-based violence during Covid-19 lockdown was unproven. A claim that half of grade 1 pupils will never write matric was incorrect. The two correct claims covered renewable energy procurement and economic recession before the coronavirus outbreak. A claim that most municipalities were dysfunctional was misleading. \"Please keep your masks on and sit in your designated area,\" Amos Masondo, chairperson of South Africa's national council of provinces, told the scattered group of parliamentarians gathered for the annual debate on the state of the nation address, known as Sona. President Cyril Ramaphosa's 2021 Sona speech was held on 11 February 2021, an event Covid-19 regulations stripped of its usual fanfare. In the debate that started five days later, government ministers and members of parliament lowered their masks to praise and criticise the president, his government and the state of the country. This fact-check examines five claims made in the debate. They cover gender-based violence, education, renewable energy, the economy and how well municipalities function. GBVF is gender-based violence and femicide, the latter meaning the killing of females . The claim was made by Hlengiwe Mkhize, the presidency's deputy minister for women, youth and persons with disabilities, who suggested that the decrease in this violence was due to South Africa's Covid-19 lockdown. Africa Check has contacted Mkhize's office to find out what period she was referring to and what data set was used to support the statistic. Despite numerous requests, we have not received a response. Reported sexual crimes decreased during hard lockdown The South African Police Service (SAPS) has previously told Africa Check that they consider all contact crime against women \u2013 including murder, rape and physical abuse \u2013 to be gender-based violence. Without confirmation from Mkhize about the time frame she was referring to it is difficult to verify the claim. The police's latest crime statistics reveal that 171,070 contact crimes against women were reported between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. But this includes just three months of 2020 and five days of the country's hard Covid-19 lockdown, which started at midnight on 26 March 2020 . The crime statistics for 2020/21 will be released later this year. The police recently started releasing crime statistics per quarter: April to June, July to September, October to December and January to March. But while the annual crime statistics provide a breakdown of crimes against women, the quarterly reports do not. Despite this, the quarterly report for the April to June 2020 indicates a significant decrease in reports of sexual offences (against all sexes) compared to the previous period. This period coincided with level 5 and level 4 of lockdown. It shows that sexual offences \u2013 a broad category including a number of crimes \u2013 decreased by 39.7% compared to the same three-month period in 2019. Rape decreased by 40.4% , sexual assault by 35.9% , attempted sexual assault by 40.3% and contact sexual crimes by 36.2% . There were also significant decreases in reported crimes across the board, including murder, common robbery and carjacking. Other statistics , released by police minister Bheki Cele for the first month of hard lockdown (27 March to 22 April 2020), showed more dramatic decreases in crime. Rape decreased by 87.2% , murder by 72% , and domestic violence by 69.4% compared to the same period in 2019. Based on a lack of data supporting or refuting the claim, we rate it unproven. Alcohol ban may have contributed It is not clear what period Mkhize was referring to or what statistic she was citing. But Chandre Gould , a senior research fellow for the justice and violence prevention programme at the Institute of Security Studies Africa , told Africa Check that using reported incidences as an indicator of a real decrease in gender-based violence was not recommended. In an article for the institute, she wrote that despite fears that gender-based violence would increase in South Africa during the hard lockdown, some rape reporting centres said calls had decreased by as much as 50% . She said the ban on alcohol may have contributed to this decrease as it may have \"reduced the severity of domestic violence cases and the opportunity for rape (outside of the home)\". Women may have found it much more difficult to report domestic violence during this period because they could not get to a police station or make private calls away from their partner. \"I think the important point is that we are talking about reported cases, so the actual violence may not have decreased,\" she told Africa Check. South Africa's 2020 matrics \u2013 final-year high school students \u2013 achieved a 76.5% pass rate. This was 5.1 percentage points lower than the previous year's rate, which the department of basic education said may be attributed to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The claim was made by Baxolile Nodada, the Democratic Alliance's shadow minister of basic education. When Africa Check asked him for the source of the claim, he sent us an official party statement that calculated a \"real\" pass rate for public schools. This pegged the rate at 41% by comparing the number of students enrolled in grade 1 in 2009 to the number of students who passed the matric exams in 2020. According to data from the Department of Basic Education, 1,071,905 students were in grade 1 in 2009. Twelve years later, in 2020, 578,468 matric students wrote the school-leaving exams. A basic assessment of these figures (which experts don't recommend \u2013 see below) does not support Nodada's claim. It suggests that 53.97% of grade 1 students went on to write the final exam. ( Note: This is based on public school data. Private school students write a separate set of final exams under the Independent Education Board.) High level of repetition 'make calculations difficult' But Martin Gustafsson , a researcher with the department of economics at Stellenbosch University , advises against this type of calculation. He told Africa Check that high repetition in schools meant it was inappropriate to compare the number of students in grade 1 with the number of matric students who subsequently wrote (or passed ) the final exams 12 years later. \"My warning would always be please don't compare grade 1 to grade 12 because grade 1 has lots of repeaters,\" Gustafsson explained. \"So you're double-counting people.\" Statistics published in 2020 by the department of basic education indicate that 15% of grade one students repeat and 10% of grade 2 and grade 3 students repeat. \"Repetition is like the fly in the soup. It makes all these calculations difficult.\" Over 52% youth attain matric by the age of 24 Not every student will write matric after just 12 years of school \u2013 some will write and achieve their matric qualification after a number of attempts. According to South Africa's 2019 general household survey, 24.3% of people aged 20 are still in secondary school. Gustafsson previously provided Africa Check with a graph that uses data from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 general household surveys as well as Independent Education Board data. He found that just over 40% of people obtained a matric pass by the age of 20. This number increased to just over 52% by the age of 24. The figure would be higher if students who wrote but failed the exam were included. We rate Nodada's claim as incorrect. This statement was by Kevin Mileham, the Democratic Alliance's shadow minister of mineral resources and energy. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPP) was set up in 2010 to increase the country's renewable energy supply and help achieve broader national development goals, such as job creation. The programme encourages investment in independent power producers (IPPs). These entities own or operate facilities that generate electric power for sale. To help the government reach its energy targets, IPPs are meant to generate 39,696 megawatts of energy to be added to the national grid by 2030. IPPs have been invited to bid to provide this energy during certain timeframes. There have been seven competitive bid windows so far, the last one in 2015. From these bid windows, the REIPPP has procured 6,422 megawatts of electricity from 112 IPPs. As at June 2020, 4,276 megawatts had been connected to the national grid. The remaining energy will become operational once the projects from the last bidding windows have been constructed. No energy procured since 2015 It is correct to say that no energy has been procured since the last bid window in 2015. According to the REIPPP, future bid windows are on hold while a new Integrated Resource Plan , an electricity infrastructure development strategy introduced in 2019, is implemented. The next bid window \"should be launched soon\", Prof Anton Eberhard, director of the Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town's Graduate School of Business , told Africa Check. There may also be some nuclear procurement, after a decision to procure 2,500 megawatts of nuclear power through the programme, he said. But this is pending approval from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa . Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), drew attention to the state of the economy before the pandemic. Africa Check has previously looked into the definition of a recession and most experts agree it refers to two or more consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Statistics South Africa , the country's data agency, also uses the same definition . The size of an economy is measured in gross domestic product (GDP). This represents the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. The first case of Covid-19 was recorded in South Africa on 5 March 2020, close to the end of the year's first quarter. In January, February and March that year, South Africa's GDP contracted by -1.8% . In the third and fourth quarters of 2019 , South Africa's GDP also contracted, by -0.8% and -1.4% respectively. \"Our economy was in a decline, that's not a secret,\" Prof Jannie Rossouw , head of the school of economic and business sciences at Wits University , told Africa Check. This claim was made by Andrew Arnolds, the EFF's Western Cape provincial secretary. South Africa is divided into eight metropolitan municipalities, 205 local municipalities and 44 district municipalities. This gives a total of 257 municipalities. Claim based on government from 2018 Andrews told Africa Check that his claim was based on information from the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta). The department is responsible for overseeing local governments. Cogta's list of dysfunctional and distressed municipalities , published in 2018, includes \"87 priority municipalities that were identified as distressed or dysfunctional requiring urgent intervention\". But what about the other municipalities? In 2018 then minister of Cogta, Zweli Mkhize, said : \"Seven percent of the country's municipalities are classified as well-functioning, 31% are reasonably functional, thirty one percent are almost dysfunctional while the remaining 31% is dysfunctional.\" ( Note: We asked the department how each status was defined. We have not received a response. ) Status of South Africa's municipalities Status Percentage Well-functioning 7% Reasonably functional 31% Almost dysfunctional 31% Dysfunctional 31% Source: Department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs In a 2019 update , the department said 24 of the dysfunctional municipalities had \"significantly improved in terms of performance\". Africa Check asked Cogta spokesperson Lungi Mtshali for an updated list. At the time of publishing he had not provided it. Definitions of 'dysfunctionality' can vary EFF researcher Gumedi Tshimomola told Africa Check that the party only considered the \"well-functioning\" 7% of municipalities to be \"functional\", with the rest all dysfunctional. South Africa's Financial and Fiscal Commission has highlighted that \"many stakeholders define functionality differently\". The independent institution was created to provide and make recommendations to government organisations on financial matters. In a 2020 review on municipal dysfunctionality it pointed to the absence of a \"common, government-wide definition of a dysfunctional municipality\". The commission said that referring to \"all municipalities that are not functioning normally or as expected\" as dysfunctional was \"conceptually flawed\". The organisation recommended that a definition should recognise that \"many municipalities are neither functional nor dysfunctional, but somewhere in between\". Sabelo Mtantato , a senior researcher at the commission's fiscal policy unit, told Africa Check \"things must have changed significantly\" since the 2018 list of dysfunctional municipalities were released. Arnold used the EFF's own definition of \"functionality\", and his data does not represent the current state of South Africa's municipalities. We therefore rate the claim as misleading.",

        "doc": "The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a South African political party, launched its election manifesto on 2 February 2019 in the country's Gauteng province. The national election is scheduled for 8 May 2019. The party claims that \"landlessness and joblessness among black South Africans are at crisis levels, posing the biggest challenges that confront South African society today\". This report fact-checks five claims about land occupation, school dropout rates, unemployment, land redistribution and gender balance. Claim \"80% of the population continues to occupy less than 10% of South Africa's land\" Verdict incorrect The EFF bases its claim on ownership data and the size of the African and coloured population. The party's national communications manager, Sixolise Gcilishe, explained how it was calculated: Total land area: 122 million hectares minus 67% \u2013 white-owned agricultural land minus 14% \u2013 state land minus 5% \u2013 land owned by Indians* equals 14% of land \"left for black African and coloured South Africans\", who make up 88% of the population *This number is rounded off. The number the EFF provided was 4.82%. This fact-check evaluates each of the EFF's assumptions stated above. Is 67% of SA land white-owned agricultural land? In 1993, the year before South Africa's first democratic election, a Stats SA agricultural census estimated the country had about 82 million hectares of agricultural land. The government has referred to this land as \"white-owned agricultural land\". This was 67% of South Africa's total land. The EFF said work by Plaas, the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies at the University of the Western Cape, was the source of the 67% used in its calculation. The number is contained in a 2013 Plaas fact-check on land distribution co-authored by Prof Cherryl Walker, a professor of sociology at the University of Stellenbosch. She said the 67% was commercial farmland historically reserved for white ownership, but it shouldn't be assumed to be the share in white hands today. Since 1994 black people have acquired some of this land through private sales and loans. Prof Ben Cousins of Plaas described the EFF estimates as \"highly misleading\". He said much of the land acquired for land reform since 1994 was \"no doubt farmland, and no longer forms part of the 67% of the total land area formerly in the hands of white farmers\". A report on land redistribution commissioned by parliament says \"some land acquired or transferred may not be commercial agricultural land\u2026 Nonetheless, we may presume that most may be considered land zoned for agriculture outside of the former Bantustans\". How much agricultural land is owned by white people? The available data is limited. According to the 2017 state land audit , farms and other agricultural land amounted to just over 111 million hectares in 2015. The audit only provides a racial breakdown for agricultural land owned by individuals, some 37 million hectares . It estimates that white people own 72% of this land \u2013 26.7 million hectares. An Agri SA land audit estimated that white farmers owned 68.5 million hectares of agricultural land in 2016. This includes land owned by companies and trusts and amounts to 56% of total land. Agricultural economist Wandile Sihlobo gave Africa Check an estimate of agricultural land not owned by white people. It identifies 17.5 million hectares of farmland as \"not owned by whites\". The calculation was done with the help of agricultural economist Prof Johann Kirsten of the University of Stellenbosch and based on data from 2015 and 2017. It is made up of agricultural land owned by the state, redistributed and restored land and a \"guesstimate\" of the land bought by willing black buyers from willing white sellers. It also includes a hectare equivalent of money paid in land restitution claims. A February 2019 Plaas working paper, co-authored by Kirsten, contains an updated calculation , which relies on 2018 data from the department of rural development and land reform. South African land redistribution numbers Type Land (hectares) Agricultural land acquired by the state since 1994 and still held by the state for land reform purposes 2,289,063 Redistribution 4,901,150 Restitution 3,692,294 Subtotal 10,882,507 Private transactions (without the involvement of the department of rural development and land reform) 1,968,057 Total 12,850,564 Source: Plaas working paper ( Note: This calculation does not include a hectare equivalent of compensation paid for restoration.) Using these redistribution numbers, and an estimated 643,995 hectares of agricultural land acquired by the state for development purposes, it estimates that 64.8 million hectares of farmland (53% of total land) is owned by white people. The available data therefore does not support the EFF's assumption that 82 million hectares of agricultural land \u2013 67% of South Africa's land \u2013 is in white hands. Is state land unoccupied? The 2017 state land audit focused on privately owned land. The previous audit, published in 2013, identified 17.1 million hectares or 14% of the total land as state-owned land. But Cousins said \"state land\" could be a misleading category. \"It includes land held for nature conservation, state forests, water and defence force use. It also includes [land] in the traditional areas. \" The 2019 Plaas working paper estimates land under traditional tenure to be 18.4 million hectares \u2013 or 15% of total land. Economist Johann Bornman, given as a source for calculations of land size in the working paper, said that in 2018 the rural development and land reform department updated its estimate of land in the former homelands to this number. Dr Aninka Claassens, chief researcher at the Land and Accountability Research Centre , said the EFF \"seems to ignore the fact that black South African have underlying rights to all the land in the former homelands, which is state land\". (Note: In the explanation of its calculation, the EFF said it was \"almost impossible to scientifically determine\" how state land was occupied. We have asked Stats SA to help us determine who occupies land in the former homelands and will update this fact-check once we have the results. ) How much land do Indian South Africans own? The 2017 state land audit found that 77% of land (94 million hectares) was privately owned. But only the race of individual owners of 37.8 million hectares could be determined. And these numbers may not be spot-on. The deeds registry does not record the race of land owners. In cases where the race could not be derived from Stats SA data, names and surnames were used. \"The indirect extraction of race data\u2026 exposed the land audit to the risk of under- or over-reporting,\" the audit report says. The EFF calculation assumes 5 % of South Africa's total land ( 5.9 million hectares) is owned by Indians. But this is not supported by the land audit, which puts individual Indian ownership at 2.1 million hectares, including sectional title property. The rural development and land reform department previously told Africa Check it did not include sectional title units when calculating land owned by individuals \"as they include units in high-rise buildings such as flats, office buildings\u2026 which may distort the numbers\". Individual land ownership by race in South Africa Race Farms and agricultural holdings Erven Sectional title Total hectares Share of SA land Indian 5% 8% 5% 2.1 million 2% African 4% 30% 17% 1.5 million 1% Coloured 14% 8% 21% 5.4 million 4% White 72% 49% 45% 27 million 22% Source: 2017 state land audit ( Note: Percentages don't add up to 100% because the categories \"co-ownership\" and \"other\" are left out.) Indian people may own land through trusts, companies and community organisations but there is no data on this. The same goes for African and coloured people, who own 6.9 million hectares of individually owned land or close to 6% of the total land. Coloured and African people together make up close to 90% of the population, according to StatsSA's 2018 mid-year population estimates . What's missing? The 2017 land audit only gives data on the race of the owners of about a third of the land. A breakdown by race for other types of private ownership is not available. It is also silent on who occupies this land \u2013 in some cases, owners do not occupy their land \u2013 as well as on who occupies land in the former homelands. The EFF's calculation also does not take into account erven and sectional title units owned by white people. Verdict: Incorrect The EFF's calculation makes assumptions about ownership to support a claim about the occupation of land. It incorrectly assumes white people own 82 million hectares of agricultural land and overestimates land individually owned by Indians. It is therefore incorrect. Claim \"South Africa has one of the highest school dropout rates\" Verdict incorrect The EFF's claim applies to a worldwide comparison, the party's national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe confirmed. She referred us to three documents to support the statement. The common thread in these documents is work done by Professor Martin Gustafsson, an education economist and member of the Research on Socioeconomic Policy group at the University of Stellenbosch. However, Gustafsson does not agree that his work supports the EFF's claim. \"In fact, as far as secondary [school] completion is concerned \u2013 that's essentially what this is about \u2013 we're fairly normal for a middle-income country,\" he said. Measuring dropout rates Gustafsson said it was \"widely accepted\" that the dropout rate was difficult to calculate, \"especially in developing countries, where data systems are limited\". However, he said, education planners regarded the definition of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) as useful: \"The proportion of pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who are no longer enrolled in the next school year.\" Gustafsson noted that the Unesco definition related to individual grades. \"So one can talk about a dropout rate for Grade 10, another one for Grade 11 and so on.\" One of the alternative methods to calculate the dropout rate is to use data from household surveys to determine what proportion of the population has obtained a matric certificate. Gustafsson said this method was not ideal, but was an \"adequate stopgap\". It was the method used by the department of basic education in response to a parliamentary question about dropout rates in June last year. What is SA's dropout rate? The written reply contains an estimated dropout rate for those born between 1990 and 1992. Information from Statistics South Africa's (Stats SA) General Household Survey for 2014 to 2016 was used to estimate that 51.5% of these people had completed Grade 12. We asked the department of basic education to provide more recent calculations if they were available, but it failed to respond to our query. International comparisons One of the documents the EFF referred to in support of its claim is a 2011 working paper authored by Gustafsson, but it did not include a worldwide comparison. The working paper looked at Grade 12 completion rates in 14 countries, including Turkey, Brazil and Chile, based on data from 2003 to 2009. South Africa was ranked 12th. Gustafsson referred Africa Check to Unesco's upper secondary school completion rates as a source of more recent data that would allow for a global comparison. Based on these figures, the department's 2018 matric examination report concluded that \"the upper secondary education completion [Grade 12] rate for South Africa has been equal to that of middle-income countries in general in recent years\". We compared the average upper secondary education completion rates of 68 countries for which Unesco data were available \u2013 for the five years from 2014 to last year \u2013 and found that 38 countries had lower completion rates than South Africa. Gustafsson said while South Africa's secondary completion rate was \"fairly normal for a middle-income country\", we should aim to increase it, as many other countries are doing. He warned that \"defining our vast educational inequalities only in terms of school completion would be incorrect. Many of our inequalities relate to the quality of education, not the years of schooling completed by young people.\" Verdict: Incorrect The EFF's claim that South Africa's school dropout rate is among the worst in the world is incorrect. Unesco data for 2014 to last year show that South Africa was in the top 50% of 68 countries based on secondary school completion. Claim \"Close to 40% of South Africans who need jobs are unemployed, meaning that more than nine million South Africans who need jobs and are capable of working cannot find employment.\" Verdict correct Stats SA's Quarterly Labour Force Survey measures unemployment in two ways \u2013 according to the narrower, official definition and according to the expanded definition. The agency's acting chief director for labour statistics, Malerato Mosiane, explained: \"The difference between the official and expanded definition of unemployment is that the job search criterion is relaxed in the expanded definition.\" In the case of the official definition, someone has to be without work, available for work and searching for work or trying to start a business. The expanded definition does not require a person to be looking for a job \u2013 they just need to be without work and available for work. At the time the EFF released its manifesto on February 2, the latest available Quarterly Labour Force Survey was for the third quarter of last year . According to the report and based on the official definition of unemployment , 6.2 million people were unemployed at that time. This means that they: Were between the ages of 15 and 64; Were not employed in the week before the survey interview; and Actively looked for work or tried to start a business in the four weeks before the interview, and would have been able to start work or a business in the week before the interview. A person was also considered unemployed if they \"had not actively looked for work in the past four weeks, but had a job or business to start at a definite date in the future and were available\". A further 2.7 million were identified as discouraged work seekers . This group of people wanted to work, but did not try to find work because of a lack of jobs in their area, because they had lost hope or could not find work requiring their skills. An additional 817,000 people without work provided reasons for failing to search for a job other than the ones contained in the definition of a discouraged work seeker. These included ill health, a disability, pregnancy, childcare duties and a lack of transport, said Mosiane. Capability not part of either definition The unemployed, discouraged work seekers and those with other reasons for not searching for a job make up the expanded definition of unemployment. According to this definition, close to 9.8 million people, or 37.3% , of the labour force ( 26.1 million ) were unemployed in the third quarter of last year. While Mosiane noted that the EFF's claim used the term \"capable\", which was not part of the official or the expanded definition of unemployment, the numbers in the claim most closely match the expanded definition. Academics have argued that there is little to distinguish between the two definitions in South Africa. Stats SA previously told Africa Check that the expanded definition is a more stable indicator. EFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe confirmed to Africa Check that the party had applied the expanded definition in this case. Verdict: Correct The EFF's claim that more than 9 million \u2013 or close to 40% \u2013 of South Africans who need jobs are unemployed is correct. Almost 9.8 million people \u2013 or 37.7% of the labour force \u2013 were unemployed according to the expanded definition of unemployment in the third quarter of last year. Claim \" The post-1994 governments have cumulatively bought less than 7% of the targeted 30% of land meant for redistribution over a period of 25 years. \" Verdict incorrect In 2012, then rural development and land reform minister Gugile Nkwinti used his budget vote speech to \"clarify\" government's 30% target for land reform. Nkwinti said the target applied to white-owned agricultural land \u2013 close to a third of which government wanted to distribute to the historically disadvantaged by 2014. When the target was set in 1994, white-owned agricultural land was estimated to be 82 million hectares , he said. The 30% came to 24.6 million hectares, which were earmarked for all three components of land reform, namely restitution, redistribution and tenure reform, according to the department of rural development and land reform. The department pointed out that it would be incorrect to still use the 30% target as it applied until 2014. The current target is to redistribute \"20% of agricultural farming land by 2030\" , in line with the National Development Plan . We were unable to confirm with the department by the time of publication whether land previously redistributed would count towards the new target. How much land has the state bought? EFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe told us the party based its claim on a 2016 report on land reform commissioned by a high-level panel on the assessment of key legislation and the acceleration of fundamental change. The panel, chaired by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, was tasked with assessing the effectiveness of legislation that has come into effect since 1994. Land reform was one of the focus areas of the panel's work. According to the report, authored by the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (Plaas) at the University of the Western Cape, \"about 5 million hectares\" were redistributed between 1994 and 2014/15. A further 3.2 million hectares were restored through restitution by 2014/15. This comes to 8.2 million hectares, or 6.7%, of the total land in South Africa ( 122 million hectares ). The EFF told us this was how it reached the figure of \"less than 7%\". The latest available data , according to the department, largely correspond with the data in the Plaas report. They show that the state has bought 4.9 million hectares for land redistribution since 1994, and a further 3.3 million hectares for restitution. Land acquired for tenure reform (782,487 hectares) was included in the 4.9 million hectares, said the department. It would therefore be correct to say that government has bought less than 7% of the total land in South Africa, but it is incorrect to say that the state has only bought 7% of the targeted 30%. The state has bought 8.2 million hectares \u2013 or 33% \u2013 of the targeted 24.6 million hectares. Not all of the land bought or transferred to beneficiaries for the purpose of land redistribution is necessarily commercial agricultural land. According to another commissioned high-level panel report, \"some land acquired may be in urban areas or in communal areas, and may have been land acquired for non-agricultural purposes \u2013 before land reform became equated with agriculture. Nevertheless, we may presume that most may be considered land zoned for agriculture outside of the former Bantustans.\" Redistribution, restitution and tenure reform The EFF's claim only mentions land acquired for redistribution, but land was also bought for restitution and tenure reform. The Plaas report explains the difference: \"Soon after the first election in 1994, an ambitious policy of land reform began to be implemented. This included a land redistribution programme aimed at broadening access to land among the country's black majority; a land restitution programme to restore land or provide alternative compensation to those dispossessed as a result of racially discriminatory laws and practices since 1913; and a tenure reform programme to secure the rights of people living under insecure arrangements on land owned by others, including the state (in communal areas and the former 'coloured' rural reserves) and private landowners (farm workers, farm dwellers and labour tenants).\" The department confirmed that the amount of land bought for restitution excluded cases in which compensation was paid because land could not be restored or because beneficiaries chose to be compensated instead. Verdict: Incorrect The claim that the government has bought less than 7% of the land initially meant for redistribution since 1994 is incorrect. Data show that it has bought a third \u2013 or 8.2 million hectares \u2013 of the land. Claim The EFF\u2026  \"has a higher gender balance in parliament.\" Verdict correct Women and girls make up 51% of the country's population, according to Statistics South Africa's 2018 mid-year population estimates . But the people most political parties choose to represent them in the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces don't reflect this. In its 2019 election manifesto , the EFF claims to have a \"higher gender balance\" in parliament. We asked the party if this means it has a higher share of women among its representatives in parliament than other parties. EFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe didn't respond to the question but did send us a spreadsheet. According to this, 40% \u2013 or 10 \u2013 of the EFF's National Assembly members and 67% (4) of its National Council of Provinces members were female. Two houses of parliament South Africa has a bicameral parliament with two houses: the National Assembly (NA) and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). National Assembly The EFF published its election manifesto on 2 February 2019. We used the most recent list of NA members, provided by parliament, and a list of changes in membership to work out the gender breakdown at the time the EFF released its election manifesto. The African National Congress (ANC) had a higher share of female NA representatives, at 50%, while 44% of the EFF's NA members were female. Members of the National Assembly by party and sex in South Africa (2 January to 1 February 2019) Party Female MPs Male MPs Share of women ANC 122 120 50% EFF 11 14 44% ACDP 1 2 33% Cope 1 2 33% DA 29 59 33% UDM 1 3 25% IFP 2 8 20% NFP 1 5 17% Agang SA 0 2 0% AIC 0 3 0% APC 0 1 0% FF+ 0 4 0% PAC 0 1 0% Source: Parliament of South Africa We compared the list provided by parliament to information on the People's Assembly website and parliament's own website. We found one female ANC member who had been excluded from the list of female members. National Council of Provinces The EFF had the highest share of women (67%) in the NCOP when the party released its manifesto, based on a list of current members and resignations provided by NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise's office. Members of the National Council of Provinces by party and sex (2 January to 1 February 2019) Party Female MPs Male MPs Share of women EFF 4 2 67% ANC 13 20 39% DA 3 10 23% UDM 0 1 0% Source: Parliament of South Africa Total for both houses of parliament But how do the numbers add up for both houses of parliament? For the EFF, 48% of all its members of parliament were female when the party released its manifesto. The ANC had a higher share: 49% of its members were female. Members of parliament by party and sex (2 January to 1 February 2019) Party Female MPs Male MPs Share of women ANC 135 140 49% EFF 15 16 48% ACDP 1 2 33% Cope 1 2 33% DA 32 69 32% NFP 1 5 17% UDM 1 4 20% IFP 2 8 20% Agang SA 0 2 0% AIC 0 3 0% APC 0 1 0% FF+ 0 4 0% PAC 0 1 0% Source: Parliament of South Africa Verdict: Correct The EFF claimed it had \"a higher gender balance\" in parliament. The data shows it had a higher share of female representatives in parliament than 11 other parties at the time it released its election manifesto. Forty-eight percent of the EFF's members of parliament were women, compared with 49% of the ANC's members. This package is part of a journalism partnership with South African newspaper City Press . The project aims to ensure that claims made by those in charge of state resources and of delivering essential services are factually correct. In the run-up to this year's national and provincial elections, it is increasingly important that voters are able to make informed decisions. This series aims to provide voters with the tools to do that.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: This Facebook account claims to offer quick loans to Kenyans. But it is run by a known scammer using the same phone number with a different name. The Facebook account Michael Loans claims to offer Kenyan Facebook users different kinds of loans, such as for starting a business, paying rent, settling personal bills and emergencies. The account claims it can deposit up to KSh450,000 (US$3,000) in loans to users' M-Pesa accounts \"in 3 minutes\". All users are asked to do is reach out to the account through a WhatsApp number and say how big a loan they need. M-Pesa is a mobile financial service by Safaricom , Kenya's largest telecoms company. The posts include photos of wads of cash, both Kenyan shillings and US dollars. Some of its ads congratulate those it claims have already received the loans. The account's posts have featured prominently on different Facebook groups with thousands of members. Offers, some attracting hundreds of enquiries, have been posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is the account and the offers legit? We checked. Offers by known fraudster We noted that the account has no posts on its timeline. This is suspicious for an account that claims to offer financial services. The genuine accounts of legitimate businesses usually run promotions on their own timelines and not on different Facebook groups. The account also doesn't link to any website, which is another red flag since legitimate financial services providers usually have websites or apps where customers can get more information about their services and make transactions. Furthermore, the account's supposed business is not branded. It is missing crucial elements, such as a logo and colours, that usually identify a legit business. Its ads contain grammatical errors and use the same photos over and over, with some appearing blurry. The account does list a phone number for users to make their loan applications on WhatsApp. But we discovered that the phone number given was used by a separate Facebook account to offer fake loans that required users to pay registration fees to access the loans. We paid the registration fee but did not receive any loan. Africa Check debunked the account and its offers. The account in question is probably run by the same person and its offers are fake.",

Six suspicious pages are offering loans in the name of Nigerian financial services company OPay, but should be ignored. The Facebook accounts OPay loan services , OPay loan service , Opay loan services , OPay loan apply , Opay loan services and OPay Loan Service are offering loans to Nigerians on Facebook. These accounts use the name of OPay , a digital financial service company operating in Nigeria. Some of the accounts also use the logo of the company as their profile picture. A post from one of the accounts, published 3 December 2023, reads: \"Get business Loans and personal Loans AVAILABLE to all Opay USERS/POS merchants>>apply in minutes you can also the admin to apply 09065117940\". Similar offers have been posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the offers legit? We checked. Suspicious Facebook pages The Facebook pages in question were all formed in 2023 , according to their page transparency sections. The Facebook pages have small numbers of followers and minimal activity on their timelines, which is suspicious considering they are meant to represent a company serving millions of clients. Africa Check found the official Facebook page of OPay. It was created in 2019 and has over 444,000 followers. The page is also verified by Meta. There are links to OPay's verified Facebook page and other official social media profiles on the company's website. But we couldn't find any links to the suspicious Facebook pages. Loan services on OPay OPay, in a 2 December 2023 reply to a customer's enquiry on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), said loan services were currently unavailable on the mobile application. \"Please be informed that Loan services are currently unavailable on OPay,\" reads another post.

        "doc": "IN SHORT: The name of Kenya's first lady, Rachel Ruto, is no doubt among the most misused by scammers on social media platforms. Here are another three fake Facebook pages running bogus promotions in her name. The Facebook pages Rachael Chebet Rutho KE , Hon Rachel Chebet Loans and Hon Rachael Chebet Loans are running promotions and offering loans to Kenyans. The pages use the name and photos of Kenya's first lady Rachel Ruto, wife of president William Ruto, to run the offers. One of the page's posts, dated 14 October 2023, reads : \"Chagua kitu Moja unataka kwa sahii PESA, FEES, BIASHARA Kisha uangalie inbox yako. Get loan from 10k up to 300k. Call 0746756106 or Whatsapp 0762575396.\" The mix of English and Kiswahili translates to: \"Choose one thing that you want now between money, school fees and business then check your inbox. Get a loan from KSh10,000 up to KSh300,000. Call 0746756106 or Whatsapp 0762575396.\" This is just one of many suspicious promotions and loan offers run by the pages and flagged by Facebook as potentially false. They have been posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the pages and their offers to be trusted? We checked. Signs of fake pages and offers Africa Check noted that the posts on the pages are poorly written. They feature randomly capitalised letters, odd punctuation, a casual mix of English and Kiswahili, and repetitions. This is the first sign that the offers are a scam and are not from legitimate pages. One would expect the first lady's posts to be well-written without obvious grammatical errors. It is also odd that Ruto would opt to give loans to strangers on Facebook groups using unverified and unpopular Facebook pages. Usually, the first lady's programmes would be run professionally, in close coordination with relevant government ministries, not in her personal capacity. We also noted that the pages list phone numbers through which users can ask for the loans or claim their prizes. This is another sign of a scam. The first lady's official Facebook page, Mama Rachel Ruto , is verified and has over one million followers. We found no such offers on her page. Africa Check has exposed similar pages using Ruto's name here and here . The Facebook pages in question are fake and their offers are a scam.

But the NNPC says it has no intention of increasing fuel prices in October, despite online speculation. Soon after the removal of controversial fuel subsidies in May 2023, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company , or NNPC Limited , Nigeria's state-owned oil company, stopped being the sole supplier of petroleum products in the country. Before the removal of the subsidy , the price of petrol per litre was below N200, but with the NNPC's price review in May , it started selling for between N480 and N570 per litre. Fuel prices rose again in July and at time of publication petrol sells for between N598 and N617 per litre, depending on where you buy it. However, a post on Facebook in Nigeria on 6 October claims that the NNPC is planning to increase fuel prices for a third time in 2023. The post reads: \"NNPC opens up on plan to increase fuel price as landing cost hits N720 per litre.\" We found the same claim on Facebook here , here ,and here . But has the NNPC said it will raise fuel prices again, heralding more pain at the pump for consumers? We checked. NNPC says it won't increase fuel prices In August, the oil company denied claims that there would be an increase in the pump price of petrol. Following the latest claims the company has again refuted claims that it plans to raise prices. In a statement on its official X handle (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter), it said, in part: \"We do not have the intention to increase our PMS pump prices as widely speculated.\" PMS refers to premium motor spirit , otherwise known as petrol or gasoline. It is used to power cars, generators and other internal combustion engines .",

But the activities of the page are suspicious and users should tread carefully. The Facebook page Fulltradex investment company often congratulates users on profits apparently made through a platform known as Dell Finance Investment. A typical post reads : \"Congratulations On your successfully withdrawal dear.\" The posts are accompanied by a screenshot of what appears to be a received email with the subject: \"WITHDRAWAL SUCCESSFUL.\" But can anyone benefit from this platform or is it all just a scam? Suspicious cryptocurrency investment Africa Check clicked on the website link provided by the account \u2013 dell-finance.com \u2013 hoping to learn more about the company. But the website is inactive . A Google search for \"Dell Finance Investment\" also returned no results. This is the first red flag we noted about this page and its posts. Another one is the promise of large returns in a short period of time. In this case, the account claims that users will make 10% of what they invested every 28 hours with the \"starter plan\". If something sounds too good to be true on social media, it usually is. We then sent a private message to the account pretending to be interested in the offers. We were asked to buy Bitcoin or USDT (also known as Tether) worth US$100 from our crypto wallet and deposit it in the company. Bitcoin and USDT are both cryptocurrencies , meaning they are digital currencies that have no centralised authority, such as a bank. Financial news site Forbes Advisor has warned potential investors of what is known as a crypto investment scam. This involves the user sending \"cryptocurrency to the fraudster with promises of 'huge gains'\". But in the end, users lose their initial investment and never see the promised profits.

They stole $1.6 million from their Palestinian boss lady in Gaza.\" He goes on to say that \"according to reports\", the two Nigerian men were working at a factory in Gaza. When the Israel-Hamas war began, they broke into the factory, stole the money and tried to escape to Egypt. Israel , a country in the Middle East, declared war on the militant group Hamas on 8 October. Hamas controls the Gaza Strip , a narrow territory that lies mainly inside Israel but borders Egypt to the southwest. Its people are mainly Palestinian . The day before war was declared Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel from Gaza. The video includes five photos: police mugshots of two men, a box of cash, a person waving the flag of Palestine and bombed-out buildings. But were two men from Nigeria arrested at the border as they tried to cross from Gaza to Egypt with $1.6 million of their boss's money? And do the mugshots in the video show the two? To Nigerian nationals arrested in India The first indication that the claim is false is that the Rafah border crossing , the only way to get from Gaza to Egypt, has largely been closed since the start of the war. It's only been opened now and then for humanitarian purposes . So the two men wouldn't have been able to try to escape from Gaza to Egypt. Africa Check could find no news reports of Nigerian nationals carrying $1.6 million being arrested at the Gaza-Egypt border. We took a screenshot of the video, cropped out the mugshots and ran them through a reverse image search. This led us to a post on the social media platform X by Cyber Crime Rachakonda , a unit of the Rachakonda Police in the municipality of Hayathnagar in Hyderabad , India . The post is dated 24 August and reads : \"#Rachakonda cyber crimes arrested two #Nigerian Nationals for making friends on #SocialMedia platforms and duping victims in the guise of sending #Gift parcels. Cr. No. 87/2023 of #RachakondaPoliceCommissionerate.\" #Rachakonda cyber crimes arrested two #Nigerian Nationals for making friends on #SocialMedia platforms and duping victims in the guise of sending #Gift parcels.

No. 87/2023 of #RachakondaPoliceCommissionerate @RachakondaCop pic.twitter.com/JCeO8seFeZ \u2014 Cyber Crime Rachakonda (@CyberCrimeRck) August 24, 2023 The post includes the mugshots, as well as a press note on the two's alleged crimes, with their names. Both are 23-year-old students. News of their arrest has found its way onto several Nigeria-based websites and blogs . Two Nigerian nationals weren't arrested on the Gaza-Egypt border after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The mugshots are of two Nigerian men nabbed for cybercrime in India, in August.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT : Fake newspaper front pages are increasingly circulating on Kenyan social media platforms. One example is a cover claiming that the US Federal Reserve has launched an investigation into Kenya's 2014 Eurobond. An image of what appears to be the front page of the UK's Financial Times has been shared online in Kenya with the headline: \"US Federal reserve opens investigation on Kenya's 2014 $2.75 billion euro bond.\" The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. The page features a picture of Kenya's former president Uhuru Kenyatta . The strap line adds: \"Investigators claim $117 million moved from JP Morgan account to Kenyatta kin.\" The date of the page is 28 November 2023. The alleged author of the article is given as Demetri Sevastopulo. In June 2014, Kenyatta announced that Kenya had received a US$2 billion Eurobond, earmarked for general budget support, including infrastructure financing and the repayment of a syndicated loan. A Eurobond is a loan given out in a currency that is different to the currency of the country in which it is issued. However, despite the receipt of these funds, there have been repeated questions over the years about how the money has been spent, including by the country's auditor general . The bond matures in June 2023 . There are concerns about the country's ability to repay. The front page has also been shared here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is this a legitimate Financial Times cover? We checked. 'A complete fake' Demetri Sevastopulo is the US-China correspondent at the Financial Times. On 1 December he distanced himself from the article. \" This is a complete fake. I did not write any story about Kenya. Mr Kositany, I hope you are more careful about how you run your airports and you should be ashamed for spreading such #fakenews ,\" reads his post on his X , formerly Twitter, account. Caleb Kositany is the chair of Kenya Airports Authority , and who shared the alleged story with his more than 385,000 followers. Furthermore, the lead story on the front page of the Financial Times for 28 November is different from the one in question . The main story shared by the newspaper on its official X account was titled: \"Musk meeting extension to truce in Gaza.\" The circulating cover page is therefore fake and should be ignored.",

Three Facebook accounts Hon Rachael Rito , Hon Rachel Chebet Loans and Hon Rachael Chebet Loans are running promotions and offering free giveaways and loans to Kenyans on Facebook. Each of the three Facebook accounts feature the photo of Rachel Ruto \u2013 the wife of Kenyan president William Ruto \u2013 as their profile picture. The accounts want users to engage with their posts, apparently to stand a chance of winning thousands of Kenyan shillings or applying for loans. The accounts regularly post on Kenyan Facebook groups with thousands of members. Their posts appear here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are these accounts and the offers legit? We checked. Imposter accounts Facebook allows public figures, such as the first lady, to verify their pages on the platform. These pages then carry the \"blue tick\" verification badge. Ruto's official Facebook page, Mama Rachel Ruto , is verified and has over a million followers. We found no such offers on her page. It is unlikely that the first lady would run adverts on these less popular and unverified Facebook accounts and not feature them on her verified Facebook page. The accounts request users to reach out privately for further engagement. But these might be attempts to scam them. The Facebook accounts are fake and their offers are a scam.

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Social media posts circulating in Nigeria claim that 700 Nigerian nurses have been found to have \"fake qualifications\" by the UK's National Health Service. But this is quite a serious mangling of the facts around suspected testing centre fraud in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. \"In the UK, the NHS found 700 Nigerian nurses had fake qualifications as people stood in for their exam,\" reads a claim circulating on social media since late September 2023 . It adds : \"Nigeria is considered a 'red list' country for the recruitment of health professionals, meaning poaching of staff could endanger its own health and care system.\" The UK's state-funded National Health Service , or NHS, provides comprehensive healthcare to the public for free. The claim also appears here , here , here and here . But did the NHS really find that 700 of its nurses from Nigeria had fake qualifications? And what does the \"red list\" have to do with it? Two tests for qualified international nurses Africa Check could find no news reports or any other evidence that the NHS had found that 700 of its working nurses \u2013 Nigerian or not \u2013 were unqualified because others stood in for their exams. Instead, our research uncovered several online reports that the UK's Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) had discovered fraud at a Nigeria-based testing centre for international nurses. The NMC is a nongovernmental organisation, independent of the state-run NHS . It regulates nursing and midwifery , maintains professional standards and keeps a register of more than 788,000 nurses and midwives allowed to work in the UK. Nurses from other countries who want to register with the NMC have to pass two tests . The first is a computer-based test (CBT) usually done in the nurse's home country. The second is a practical test in the UK. But these are tests for nurses who are already qualified. 'Anomalous data' from Ibadan computer-based testing centre In a 20 September statement , the NMC said \"anomalous data\" had been found in CBT results from the Yunnik Technologies Test Centre in Ibadan , the capital of Oyo state in southwestern Nigeria. The statement reads : There is evidence of widespread fraudulent activity at the Yunnik centre, where we suspect some people fraudulently obtained their CBT, probably by use of a proxy tester, where someone takes the test on behalf of someone else. Overall, this means we cannot have confidence in any CBT result from this test centre and we're treating all CBTs obtained at Yunnik as invalid. But the NMC adds that only 48 of the 515 nurses and midwives on its register tested at Yunnik \"likely than not ... obtained their results fraudulently\". The 48 cases are to be referred to the council's investigating committee for a final decision. A possible 48 fraudulent test results that allowed people to register with the UK's nursing council does not translate to 700 unqualified nurses working for the NHS. The NMC's statement says all nurses and midwives tested at Yunnik  \u2013 on its register, or still at the application stage \u2013 will have to be retested \"to obtain a new CBT result\". \"To be clear, no final decision has been made and this does not relate to people's original nursing/midwifery qualification,\" an NMC spokesperson told Reuters . The claim is false. And its reference to the \"red list\" may be more evidence of that. Endangering the healthcare system of Nigeria, not the UK The second part of the claim reads : \"Nigeria is considered a 'red list' country for the recruitment of health professionals, meaning poaching of staff could endanger its own health and care system.\" But that means the UK recruiting health professionals from Nigeria could endanger the healthcare system of Nigeria , not the UK. The drain of healthcare brains from poorer to wealthier countries has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish its health workforce support and safeguards list . This lists countries where health professionals are most needed. It encourages other countries to not recruit from those countries. Nigeria is among 37 African countries on the safeguards list. The UK government has adopted the WHO list in a code of practice . \"Countries on the WHO Health Workforce Support and Safeguards List are graded red, which means no active recruitment is permitted from these countries,\" the code reads. This is the \"red list\" to which the claim refers. Nurses from Nigeria may work in the UK, but may not be headhunted because that could worsen healthcare in Nigeria.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: When it was announced that another six countries, including three in the Middle East, had been invited to join Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in the Brics group, claims started circulating on social media that this would mean a control of 80% of the world's oil output. But the truth is a little more complicated. The Brics group of five nations held its 15th summit in South Africa in late August 2023. Brics stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The five countries aim to help each other grow their economies and cooperate in other ways . Brics is seen as an alternative to other country groupings such as the G7 , made up of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the European Union of 27 states . During the August summit South African president Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Brics had decided to invite six more countries to join: Argentina in South America, Egypt and Ethiopia in Africa, as well as the Middle East countries of Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The six would become members in January 2024, Ramaphosa said. That would make Brics a group of 11 nations. Social media quickly responded with a claim about the hold the enlarged Brics would have on the world's oil supply. \"The new BRICS will control 80% of global oil production,\" a typical version of the claim reads. \"With the addition of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iran to the BRICS, the Union will be able to control the lion's share of the world's black gold production.\" Black gold is a term for crude oil , called \"crude\" because it still has to be refined or processed into other products. These include paraffin, kerosene, jet fuel, liquid gas and, most importantly, petrol and diesel . Another reads : \"BRICS Countries Now Control 80% Of The Worlds Oil Reserves.\" The claim can also be seen here , here and here . Is it true that the 11 countries likely to make up an expanded Brics in January 2024 control 80% of the world's oil production? Production or reserves? First, there's a difference between oil production and oil reserves. Production is when oil is pumped up and put on the market. Reserves are an informed guess about the amount of oil a country may have under the ground. This is estimated by geologists , but nobody knows for sure how much oil lies under the surface of the Earth. One country may produce more oil while another has larger reserves. In fact, production is sometimes cut back to drive up the price of oil. Six of 11 Brics countries among world's top producers The in-depth Statistical Review of World Energy has been published every year since 1952. It's produced by the Energy Institute with data from Scotland's Heriot Watt University , checked by the consulting firms Kearney and KPMG , and supported by the UK energy company BP . The review's 2023 edition , released in June, indicates that in 2022 the top two producers of oil were the US and Saudi Arabia. According to the review , about 80% of the global 4,407 million tonnes of oil produced in 2022 was from 14 countries. Three \u2013 Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 are set to join Brics in 2024. Another three \u2013 Brazil, China and Russia \u2013 are existing members of the bloc. Statistical Review of World Energy: top oil* producers in 2022 Rank Country Production in million tonnes Share of world total 1 United States 759.5 17.2% 2 Saudi Arabia** 573.1 13.0% 3 Russian Federation** 548.5 12.4% 4 Canada 274.0 6.2% 5 Iraq 221.3 5.0% 6 China** 204.7 4.6% 7 UAE** 181.1 4.1% 8 Iran** 176.5 4.0% 9 Brazil** 163.1 3.7% 10 Kuwait 145.7 3.3% 11 Mexico 97.7 2.2% 12 Norway 89.0 2.0% 13 Kazakhstan 84.1 1.9% 14 Qatar 74.1 1.7% Total: share of global production 3,592.4 81.5% Global production 4,407.2 100% Source: Statistical Review of Energy 2023 *Includes crude oil, shale oil, oil sands, condensates and natural gas liquids **Member of expanded 11-nation Brics The African countries set to be part of the 11-member Brics are Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa. The review indicates that in 2022 Africa's major oil producers were Algeria, Angola, Chad, Republic of Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan and Tunisia. It groups Ethiopia and South Africa under \"other Africa\" \u2013 40 or so countries on the continent that don't produce globally significant amounts of oil. Statistical Review of World Energy: oil* production by 11-member Brics countries in 2022 Country Production in million tonnes Share of world total Argentina 32.8 0.7% Brazil 163.1 3.7% China 204.7 4.6% Egypt 29.9 0.7% India 33.0 0.7% Iran 176.5 4.0% Saudi Arabia 573.1 13.0% Russian Federation 548.5 12.4% United Arab Emirates 181.1 4.1% Other Africa** 13.8 0.3% Total: share of global production 1,956.5 44.2% Global production 4,407.2 100% Source: Statistical Review of Energy 2023 *Includes crude oil, shale oil, oil sands, condensates and natural gas liquids **Includes Ethiopia and South Africa. Excludes Algeria, Angola, Chad, Republic of Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan and Tunisia This indicates that the 11 countries produce around 44% of the world's crude oil. When measured according to average daily output in 2022 \u2013 in thousands of barrels a day \u2013 the share is a slightly lower 43.4%. But do other data sources match up? Opec puts output at close to half of global total The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or Opec is a group of 13 major oil producers in the Middle East, Africa and South America. According to Opec's Annual Statistical Bulletin 2023 , the 11 countries produced a combined 34.7 million barrels per day in 2022. That's a slightly higher 47.6% of the global total of 72.8 million barrels a day, almost half, but still nowhere near 80%. The US government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) lists the world's top 10 producers of oil. But its definition of \"oil\" is broader. It includes, for example, biofuels or fuel made from plants, algae and other living matter. According to the EIA list , the top 10 produced 73.5% of global oil in 2022, with US output the highest at 20.8%. Again, six of the 11 countries set to make up the expanded Brics \u2013 Brazil, China, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 are among the top 10. Their combined output in 2022 was, according to the EIA, 39% of the world's total. Brics is set to control a lot of the world's oil \u2013 according to Opec, almost half \u2013 when the six new countries join the five-member bloc in January 2024. But the 11 countries don't produce a combined 80% of the global total.",

Some Nigerians have been punting an investment platform called Livent online. The platform claims to use lithium technology to make people's lives easier, but it's unclear just how the technology comes into play here. According to Facebook posts the platform can double your money within 24 hours. Other posts promise a minimum daily return of 1,000 naira for a minimum investment of 4,000 naira. \"I registered with liveth yesterday with just 4k between 24hrs I have seen my investment. Join me to enjoy this investment while it lasts. If you're interested DM [direct message],\" reads a post on Facebook. We found similar posts on Facebook here , here , here , here and here . They have also been shared on WhatsApp. They all include a link where people can apparently sign up. But is the investment platform legitimate? We checked. Livent shows signs of being a scam You can't click through to the link though, as it has been flagged as risky by web security companies such as Cloudflare. This is a red flag, and unlikely for a genuine and safe investment platform. The Corporate Affairs Commission registers companies in Nigeria. We did not find Livent after a search, as would be expected for a public investment platform. Africa Check also looked for user reviews of the platform. On the consumer website ScamAdviser , it has a low trust rating , of 21 out of 100. Hustle and Bustle, a financial review and tutorial website , reviewed the Livent platform and said it could be short lived and gave a number of reasons why. The daily return offered by Livent to Nigerians also seems too good to be true. Some users of the platform have expressed concern on Facebook, asking questions such as \"Is Livent still paying?\". Others have said that the platform has siphoned off their money. There are many signs that the platform is not to be trusted.

Africa Check has found SportyBet's official Facebook page. It has over 200,000 followers and was created on 10 January 2018. It is also verified by Meta. The company's website provides links to SportyBet's official social media pages, including its verified Facebook page. However, we were unable to find any links to the suspicious Facebook pages. Risk of identity theft Africa Check sent a message showing interest in the N30,000 (about US$33) instant bonus. We were sent a link where we were told to \"register\". The registration form asked us for our name and SportyBet details, including account number, password and PIN. On 30 September 2023, the company warned users not to share their SportyBet account details. SportBet said: \" Your OTP (One-Time Password), PIN, and Password are the keys to your SportyBet account. They should be guarded like treasure. Never share these details with anyone, not even friends or family members. SportyBet will never ask you for these sensitive credentials via email, phone calls, or messages. If someone asks for them, it's a red flag!\" In another post on X (formerly Twitter), the company said that there was no specific pattern or criteria involved in rolling out gifts because they wanted to surprise people. The company then encouraged users to visit its promotions page to access online promotions. In another post , the company said it did not have a WhatsApp line: \"Please do not reply to the message & help us in preventing scams by reporting the number. All our official communication channels are listed on the App & Website.\" Fact-checking helps protect users' personal and sensitive information. Providing such details to a suspicious page can lead to identity theft, financial loss, or unauthorised access to your betting accounts.

        "doc": "IN SHORT : Fake newspaper covers are increasingly circulating on Kenyan social media. One example is a cover story claiming that the family of former president Uhuru Kenyatta received US$117 million from Eurobonds. An image of what appears to be the front page of the Kenyan newspaper the Star has been shared online in Kenya. It's headlined: \"Kenyatta Kin received $117m Euro Bond cash.\" The circulating cover is dated 1-3 December 2023. The page features a picture of Kenya's former president Uhuru Kenyatta greeting Magana Kenyatta, identified here as his \"kin\". The strapline adds: \"Magana Kenyatta received $177 million from JP Morgan account in 2014.\" In June 2014, Kenya issued a US$2 billion Eurobond to supplement its public spending. A Eurobond is a loan given out in a currency that is different to the currency of the country in which it is issued. With the Eurobond maturing in June 2024, the Kenyan government has struggled to formulate a strategy to repay the bond. This has revived concerns about corruption and the tracking of public spending in the country. The cover has also been shared here , here , here and here . But is this a legitimate front page of the Star newspaper? We checked. 'Fake news alert' On 1 December 2023, the Star posted the circulating front page on its social media accounts with the word \"fake\" printed across it in red. \" FAKE NEWS ALERT: This is not our today's front page. Treat it as FAKE,\" reads the post on the official X, formerly Twitter, account. Africa Check also looked through the Star's front page archive and found that none of the front pages from 1 , 2 or 3 December matched the front page in circulation. The circulating front page is fabricated and should be disregarded.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: What appear to be emails between a prominent attorney and a journalist have been circulating on social media in South Africa, with the claim they reveal evidence that the journalist was bribed and fed information. But the emails have been proven to be fake and an attempt to smear City Press newspaper. \"If you still believe whatever is written/said by media people ... You're a complete fool ... Those propagandists are here to destroy other people's lives ...\" That's one caption to a screenshot of what seems to be a Gmail conversation headed \"More information for DEL\". DEL is South Africa's Department of Employment and Labour . The screenshot has been circulating on social media in South Africa since early October 2023 . It appears to be a conversation between the attorney Neville Gawula and City Press journalist Mpumzi Zuzile . City Press is a national South African Sunday newspaper. It's owned by Media24 , part of the Naspers group. The top part of the screenshot is an email supposedly from Gawula. Its timestamp is 3 October at 12:46. Part of the email address is blacked out, but it's shown in full above the message as [email protected] . The message reads: Dear Mpumzi, Thank you for the attack piece you did on DG,  Lamati last week. It went well. Now that we have established some level of trust, I  am sending you more information extracted from the investigation, but not in the report I sent you. This will help  you have impactful article this coming Sunday. Please keep my possible involvement out, because for a month no one leaked anything. You'll receive the balance of your payment after the publishing of the story. Attached you will find all the documents to support this week's story. Thobile Lamati is the director general of DEL. The email appears to include an attachment with the filename Dept of Employment Emails (Gawula Inc).pdf. The file size is given as 5123K. The second part of the screenshot, supposedly from the journalist Zuzile, is timestamped 3 October at 19:13. Again, most of the email address is blacked out. It reads: Hi Neville, Received. Mondli will approve, so I  will definitely use the information,  covering the angle you suggested, and the notes you shared are helpful. Last week's story made me look good,  because even ST never had the copy of the report. Mondli Makhanya is the editor of City Press. ST is the Sunday Times , a rival weekend newspaper owned by Arena Holdings . On 7 October, the day before the screenshot first appeared online, City Press published a report on an alleged \" R5 billion scandal \" involving DEL director general Lamati. It was written by Zuzile. According to the article , a R5 billion job creation deal between the Thuja Capital Fund and the government's Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), which falls under DEL, was cancelled after a forensic investigation ordered by labour minister Thulas Nxesi . The emails from the screenshot can also be seen here , here and here . But there's no evidence that Gawula fed Zuzile any information for the article, or paid the journalist to write it. And the emails are fake. 'Submit real evidence to press ombud' On 9 October City Press posted the screenshot on Facebook and the social media platform X , formerly Twitter, stamped \"FAKE\". In the posts, the paper writes : The City Press coverage of the canned R5 billion deal between Thuja Capital Fund and the UIF appears to have ruffled some feathers: https://brnw.ch/21wDkIf This has led to the fabrication of email correspondence between one of our journalists and a supposed handler. \"We would, however, like to ensure our readers that the below emails are completely fake, and serve to create the impression that our journalist has been paid to write said series of articles.\" It adds that the screenshot \"also tarnishes the name\" of Gawula, \"the alleged source, who has nothing to do with the articles\". City Press ascribes to the highest ethical standards, and we welcome anyone with (real) evidence that any of our journalists may have deviated from these to submit said evidence to ourselves and to the ombud, after which action will be taken. South Africa's press ombud is an independent body that, with the press council, investigates and settles complaints against print and online media. On the same day, City Press published a detailed debunk of the emails. This points out that all of the reporting was based on \"based on verified documentation\", including the report of the forensic investigation into the R5 billion deal. In other words, there would be no need for Gawula to feed documents to Zuzile or to bribe the journalist. \"City Press stands by our reporting on the canned deal, and we also stand by our journalist,\" the article reads . \"We condemn the distribution of this fake email meant to cast doubt on our reporting and invite anyone with real evidence of anything untoward to submit that evidence.\" Oddities in the emails Another sign that the emails are fake is the supposed attachment. The file size of the PDF is shown as 5123K. That's 5.1 megabytes \u2013 MB. In a real Gmail message the attachment would be displayed as a preview and the file size given as 5.1 MB. Despite repeated calls for real evidence of the supposed bribery, none has been provided. If it had been, it would have been widely reported in South Africa's media \u2013 certainly by rivals of City Press. The emails are fake and social media posts circulating them should be ignored.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Videos posted on TikTok claim that Kenya has sold four tribes and 20 counties to China. Such a major development would be significant. But it didn't happen. A video posted on TikTok in November 2023 supposedly shows a clip of a leading TV station announcing that Kenya had \"officially sold 20 counties to China\". The video features the logo of Kenyan television station KTN News and the station's anchor Eric Latiff . Kenya is divided into 47 administrative counties . The clip claims that the counties sold include Kiambu, Meru, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Naivasha, Limuru and 14 others. \"Kenyans are asked to quietly leave their things and get out of Chinese land by 1 January 2024,\" the video adds. Another video on TikTok with the same frame alters the claim to say that Kenya has officially sold \"four tribes\" to China. These are said to be Luos, Kikuyus, Kambas, and Luhya, all for a price of KSh13 trillion, or about US$85 billion. The video also says: \"These tribes will be used as farmers in China. China will first come for Kikuyu and Luhya. They are asked to cooperate or else go in pieces.\" Kenya has over 40 ethnic communities. Similar videos have also been posted on Facebook here , here , here and here and on TikTok here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Some show a compilation of clips of Kenya's president William Ruto at various events and conferences in China. They conclude that it is a bad deal for Kenya and that China is only interested in its resources. The videos have received a lot of engagement, while many TikTok users believe the claims to be true. But are they accurate and did KTN News report them? Many red flags to the claim There are several signs that the videos are fake, including poor grammar . Some videos say that Naivasha and Limuru are counties in Kenya, which is incorrect. They are cities, not counties. The fact that they don't explain why Kenya has sold the communities and counties to China, or whether it's even possible to do so, is another red flag. A closer look at one much-shared clip shows that the newsreader's lip movement is not in sync with the voiceover. Latiff is a well-known media personality with an easily recognisable voice. It's clear that the voice in the video is not his. We scoured the KTN News website , Facebook page, and X (formerly Twitter ) account for the story but came up empty, which was unexpected for such a major supposed transaction. A YouTube search for the phrase \"News hub Ruto in China\", as seen on the strap at the bottom of the circulating video, led us to the original clip . It was posted on the KTN News YouTube channel on 17 October, showing Latiff with the same background and strap. The broadcast is about Ruto's visit to China that month , where he oversaw the signing of bilateral deals. According to the report, the deals cover several sectors, including information and technology, pharmaceuticals and engineering. The video has been doctored to include false information. An audio overlay has been added.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Multiple videos and posts on social media claim a Nigerian man studying at a US university has been arrested for getting four police officers pregnant at the same time. But there's no evidence for this and the photos used as proof are old. A TikTok video went viral with a story that a Nigerian man named \"Jamil Ezebuike\", who was studying at an unnamed university in the US state of New Jersey, was arrested for impregnating four female police officers. The video includes photos supposedly showing the man being arrested and the pregnant police officers. The claim has been posted multiple times on Facebook and Instagram, including here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . Some Nigerian and Ghanaian blogs also published the story, saying that the man, who is said to be from Anambra state in southeastern Nigeria , deceived the police officers and would be deported if the court found him guilty. But is any of this true? Red flags The first sign the story is probably false is the lack of important details such as the name of the university, when and where \"Ezebuike\" was arrested, what he was charged with and the names of the police officers. This lack of detail is typical of invented viral claims. The first name \"Jamil\" is of Arabic origin and is found in the Qur'an , the Muslim holy book. It is an unlikely name for a person from Anambra, whose population is almost 100% Christian. A Google search using various keywords and phrases such as \"Nigerian student impregnates US female police officers\", \"Jamil Ezebuike\" and \"Jamil Ezebuike arrested in New Jersey\" returned no links to credible media reports. We would expect that this type of story would be reported by the US media and show up in online searches. Old and unrelated photos Reverse image searches revealed that the photos shown in the video as evidence of the story are old and unrelated. The photo of the supposed arrest is at least 20 years old and was taken in Los Angeles in the US state of California, not in New Jersey, according to the caption . One of the photos of a pregnant woman was published on Pinterest as far back as September 2015 by an account in the name \"Megan Mashburn\". The caption reads \" Police wife maternity photos. My daddy fights bad guys\". There is no indication that the unnamed woman in the photo is a police officer. Another woman pictured is Meghan Jacobs , whose police officer husband was killed while on duty in March 2016. She wore a police uniform during a photoshoot in honour of her late husband. The third woman pictured appears to be Jessica Olivas , a police officer from the state of Texas. The photo was taken in September 2019 while she was pregnant. The fourth woman pictured is also reported to be a police officer by the name of Lyndi Trischler from the state of Kentucky. The photo was taken in August 2014 , when she reportedly filed a complaint against the police department where she worked, because they refused her request to keep working till she gave birth. We found no evidence of any kind for the claim that a Nigerian student in the US was arrested for impregnating four police officers.",

But it says there are no plans to raise prices further, contrary to claims circulating on social media. After years of enjoying the benefits of highly subsidised fuel, Nigerians are getting used to higher prices after a controversial subsidy was scrapped in 2023. Before that, fuel was sold at N200 per litre. Following the removal of the subsidy, prices rose twice that year. In July, prices ranged from N598 to N617 per litre, depending on the place of purchase. Transport fares rose during the December festive season following reports of fuel shortages and price increases. Claims of costlier fuel have resurfaced in January 2024, with some social media users saying the price will double. This would have a significant impact on the cost of living, as well as likely causing a scramble to buy fuel. One Facebook post reads: \"Petrol to sell for 1200 a liter.\" The same claim appeared on Facebook here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is this true? We checked. NNPC denies plan to sharply raise fuel prices In a statement on its official X handle on 3 January, the state energy company NNPC Limited denied claims of an imminent steep increase in fuel prices. The statement reads , in part: \"NNPC Ltd. urges Nigerians to disregard unfounded rumours and assures them that there are no plans for an upward review of the PMS [petrol] price.\" The NNPC urged the public not to panic-buy, saying fuel was available nationwide.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: This Facebook account is promising Kenyans on Facebook KSh20,000 (US$130) \"free relief funds\" for answering simple questions. But the account is run by an impostor and should be ignored. The Facebook account Priince Indaah would have you believe that it is run by Kenyan musician Evance Ochieng, also known as Prince Indah. It uses his name and photos to run promotions on Facebook. The so-called promotions are in the form of questions and tasks, some as easy as naming your favourite song. A post on its timeline from 4 December 2023 reads : \"Good morning Uko online sai na haukupata promotion yetu ya jana Taja Ngoma Moja inayokubamba Kisha ujishindie zawadi Leo.\" The mix of English and Kiswahili translates to: \"Good morning. If you are online now and did not win in yesterday's promotion, name one of your favourite songs and win yourself a gift today.\" The posts have attracted hundreds of enquiries from users here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Some of these posts have been published in public Facebook groups with over 70,000 members. But are the posts legitimate? We checked. Another imposter account The first red flag is the misspelling of the musician's stage name. His stage name is Prince Indah, not \"Priince Indaah\". The promotions are too good to be true and similar to many others run by fake accounts and pages. It's unlikely that the musician would be willing to give KSh20,000 (US$130) to so many strangers on Facebook just for mentioning their favourite songs. We noticed that the account was reaching out to users, saying the promotions were \"free relief funds\" from Royal Media Services , a Kenyan media company with radio, TV and digital outlets. We searched for the promotions on the media agency's website and came up empty. The account asks users to contact a WhatsApp number to claim their reward. When we initiated a conversation on WhatsApp, we were asked to pay a \"transaction fee\" of KSh198 to another number to access the reward. This is a clear sign of a scam. The musician's official page Prince Indah is verified and has over 950,000 followers. No such promotions have been posted on his page.",

A claim shared several times on social media in Nigeria says the former lawmaker fainted upon hearing the election result, but the video shared as evidence is from 2019. \"Moment Dino Melaye fainted, when he heard the result of the gubernatorial election,\" reads a post by Ekohotblog on Facebook The post , published 13 November 2023, claims a video attached to the post shows the moment Melaye fainted after hearing the result of the election. Melaye is a former senate member who represented Kogi West senatorial district. He participated in the November election for governor in Kogi state, as a candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party . The All Progressives Congress candidate Usman Ododo won the election. Melaye is widely known as an outspoken politician who is often active on social media and engages in political trolling . The video has been viewed by over 67,000 users, shared by more than 500 times and has over 240 comments. A similar claim sharing the same video can be found here . But is the video real? We checked. Video from 2019 A Google search brought up a 2019 video on YouTube. In the video , uploaded by Channels Television , Melaye is being supported by two men. The caption of the video reads: \"How Dino Melaye Emerged, Slumped After Eight-Day Seige.\" Africa Check found that the former lawmaker was wanted for the alleged shooting of a police officer, an incident widely reported by the Nigeria media . The video shows Melaye leaving his house in police custody. It is from 2019 and does not show events after the 2023 Kogi gubernatorial election. Elections are critical events, and false information about a candidate's health could influence public perception.",

We expose four Facebook accounts misusing the name to run bogus promotions. The Facebook accounts Becky Citizen Gift , Actress Becky Ctzn KE , Becky Citizen Gifts and Becky Becky are running promotions on Facebook groups and offering thousands of Kenyan shillings in prize money. Each uses the stage name and photos of Kenyan actor Lucy Maina , who plays the lead character in the TV drama series Becky. The show airs on Citizen TV, the country's most-watched station. In the promotions, Kenyans are asked to respond to simple questions for a chance to win as much as KSh150,000 (US$974) in cash. The topics covered in their posts are wide ranging, from asking users to name English words that start with certain letters to mentioning their favourite local actors. Others simply tell users whose names start with particular letters that they have received God's blessings and further engage them in the comment section. The questions and tasks generally require little effort. The accounts have posted on different dates here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the accounts and the offers to be trusted? We checked. Imposter accounts There is little activity on each of the accounts' timelines, save for constantly changing profile pictures of Maina. The absence of similar promotions on the accounts' timelines suggests they were likely created to run fake promotions on Facebook groups. The poor writing in the posts, including misspellings and odd punctuation, is a sign that they are all scams. While each of the accounts claim the promotions are from Kenyan Citizen TV, we found no such promotions on the station's verified Facebook page . We also checked the actor's official Instagram account Lucy Maina and found no promotions offering money. The accounts want users to engage privately on WhatsApp but this is likely an attempt to scam them. They are all fake and their offers are bogus. Africa Check has exposed similar scams in Maina's name here , here and here .",

But the claim is false and users should be wary of fraudsters. \"Due to high level of complains from Kenya parents on the high cost of feeding their children, President William Kipchirchir Samoei arap Ruto have urge that the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation should open the CHILD SUPPORT scheme,\" reads a poorly written message that has gone viral on Facebook in Kenya. \"Every Kenyan parents is entitled to receive the sum of KSh10,000 for 6 months. Are You A Mother or Father in Kenya Apply Now For Government Of Kenya KSh10,000 CHILD SUPPORT Cash Transfer,\" it adds . The post includes a link to a website where Kenyan parents can supposedly apply. Other similar posts provide a WhatsApp number instead of linking to the website. The offers have been posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is president William Ruto 's government giving every Kenyan parent KSh10,000 (about US$62) to feed their children? We checked. Identifying a scam The poor writing in the posts is the first sign that they are a scam. It would be highly unusual for a government ministry to publish a notice with random capitalisation, misspellings and odd punctuation. The posts claim that Kenya's president has urged \"the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation\" to open the support scheme. But there is no such ministry in Kenya. The Kenyan government official in charge of such a ministry would normally be a \"cabinet secretary\", not a \"minister\". The closest Kenyan ministry would be the ministry of labour and social protection , with children's issues falling under the directorate of children's services in the same ministry. But no such ad has been published by the ministry on social media. When we tried to open the link on our computer, the antivirus program warned us that it was a \"malicious\" link. We took the risk \u2013 not recommended \u2013 and opened it anyway. We filled in random details on the application form, including name, mobile phone number, email address and country of origin. We were also asked whether or not we were parents. This is an indicator that the website may be trying to steal our personal information \u2013 a tactic known as phishing . The form then asked us to share the link \"with 5 groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp\" as the only way to get to the \"payment form\". This is simply engagement bait. These are social media posts that ask people to interact by liking, commenting or sharing. This increases the reach of the post, but ultimately offers no reward. Similar scam in South Africa A similar message with a link to a dodgy website is also circulating on social media in South Africa . It claims that the South African government will provide \"all South African parents\" with a child support grant of R1,100 (about US$59) for six months. Otherwise the wording is almost identical to the Kenyan claim. But this claim is also false and users should be wary of fraudsters.

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Some Facebook users claim that this video shows bandits chasing Nigerian police. But the video was first posted by a Nigerian Shi'a Muslim group, in solidarity with the Palestinian people of Gaza. A video has been posted on Facebook with the claim it shows bandits chasing Nigerian police officers in the northwestern state of Kaduna. One 19 November 2023 post is captioned, in part: \"Look at Bandits pursuing police in broad daylight. *This what happened in Kaduna yesterday just as in other parts of this country*\" The term bandits is used in Nigeria to describe armed criminal groups involved in illegal activities. The country continues to grapple with the presence of bandits, particularly in its northwestern region, where there are an estimated 30,000 bandits, according to the Institute for Security Studies . The groups range in size from 10 to over 1,000 fighters. There have been several reports of the bandits' activities, including kidnappings and attacks. The video has been posted several times on Facebook, including here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But does the video show Nigerian police officers being chased by bandits? We checked. Video is from a different event Africa Check broke down the keyframes in the video using the video analysis tool Invid. We found the original video on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, posted by a group called the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) on 16 November 2023. The account posted two videos on 16 November, including the one circulating on Facebook, and said they showed IMN followers protesting in solidarity with the \"oppressed people of #Gaza and #Palestine\". News reports corroborate that IMN followers, protesting against the treatment of the people of Gaza, clashed with the police in Kaduna state. On 7 October 2023, the Islamic militant group Hamas launched an attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip, leading to a fresh wave of the decades-old war between Israel and the Palestinian people . The IMN are also known as Shi'ites, as they follow the Shi'a branch of Islam, the second-largest after the Sunni . The IMN was founded by Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky , often described as the Shia leader in Nigeria, who has been accused of planning an Islamic revolution in Nigeria, similar to the one in Iran in the 1970s . (Note: The majority of Muslim Palestinians are Sunni , but Hamas is believed to be supported by Shi'a majority Iran, who also support the Lebanese Shi'a group Hezbollah.) The group also posted on Facebook that two members, described as martyrs , had died at the hands of Nigerian police \"during a procession in support of the Palestinian people\". The skirmish filmed in the video was between Nigerian police and pro-Palestinian protesters, not criminal \"bandits\". Misinformation about security personnel can contribute to the spread of panic and fear in an already vulnerable society.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: A message circulating on social media claims that Nigeria's universities commission has discovered and listed 100 \"fake\" professors. But the claim is false and the list is fake. A message circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook in Nigeria in early 2024 claims that the National Universities Commission (NUC) has discovered about 100 fake professors in the country's university system. The message includes screenshots that list the supposed fake professors. It reads: \" Full list of 230 fake professors discovered in 23 top Nigerian Universities. In terms of tribe, Yoruba have the highest number. In terms of gender, The female gender have the highest number. While Bayero University Kano has the highest number with 20.\" The claim can be found here , here , here , here and here . Some of the social media posts link to a report published by Channels TV, a leading national TV station, under the headline \"About 100 Fake Professors Uncovered In Nigerian Universities \u2013 NUC\". But what's the full story here? Related 2019 report doesn't include a list The Channels TV article was published in December 2019. Other media organisations also reported on the story in 2019, as can be seen here , here and here . The reports say the claim came from a statement credited to Prof Abubakar Rasheed, who was the commission's executive secretary then. The statement was published in the commission's bulletin, according to the reports. We found the bulletin dated 18 November 2019 . It focused on a retreat the commission held with vice-chancellors of Nigerian universities. The bulletin records that Rasheed asked the vice-chancellors to report \"fake\" professors in the universities. The bulletin read : \"The NUC Scribe disclosed that about 100 fake Professors' details were posted on the website and the Commission had to send the names to the various universities for verification. He enjoined the Vice-Chancellors to delegate desk officers who would be responsible for checking the list of professors in their respective universities before uploading the same on the provided website. He stressed that the fight against fake professors was a collective responsibility.\" The reports however made no mention of the commission releasing a list of names and didn't circulate any such list. Debunked by the universities and the commission Since the claim went viral in the first week of January 2024, most of the universities on the list have released official statements saying they have no \"fake\" professors and that the names listed on social media are not members of their staff. See some of the rebuttals here , here , here , here , here and here . The commission's acting executive secretary, Chris Maiyaki, also debunked the claim in an official statement: The NUC wishes to deny these media reports categorically and unequivocally. They are fake, untrue and a figment of the imagination of the author(s), all happening at an unsuitable time, when the nation is awaiting the outcome of the investigation into the fake certificate saga from universities in some neighbouring countries. Specifically, the fake news items have been circulating in two forms \u2013 (i) as a link to a 2019 online news item; and (ii) as a separate list of names of the alleged fake Professors in various Nigerian Universities, which was not the case. We consider these unfounded publications as ill-conceived and a ploy by unscrupulous persons to create in plausible a tone, disquiet, panic and provoking outcries at both the national and international levels. The statement said the issue resulted from a 2019 project in which the commission compiled and published a list of full professors in the Nigerian universities system. Maiyaki said the NUC found anomalies during the exercise, such as associate professors being listed as full professors. It then shared the collated data with the Nigerian universities \"for the purpose of authentication by the competent authorities as to who qualifies to be a full professor.\" He said the commission completed the verification in 2019.",

But the video first appeared online in 2018 and the man in it is not saying anything about Jewish people. A video posted on Facebook shows a man speaking on stage in front of a crowd. Other people can be seen sitting behind him. Towards the end of the video, they all fall when the stage collapses. Posts circulating the video claim that the man in the video is an imam and that the stage collapsed because he preached that he had a dream in which he was told that all \"Jews must be exterminated\". An imam is a person who leads a Muslim community in prayer, usually in a mosque , or place of worship. In a 21 December 2023 post the video is captioned : \"The timing is Divine! An imam in Pakistan preaches that he had a dream in which it said that all Jews must be exterminated. He goes on to say, 'If this is not true, may the ground sink beneath me.' Look what happens\u2026\" The video has been viewed by over 1,000 users and has received over 100 reactions. Antisemitism means hostility towards the Jewish people. Antisemitism across the world is reported to have increased following the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israel-Gaza war . Israel is a small country in the Middle East and the world's only Jewish state . Israel and the Palestinian people have been in conflict for decades . The Gaza Strip is a narrow territory in the Middle East bordered to its west and north by Israel. The strip is densely populated and poor. The people who live there are mainly Palestinian. Gaza has been ruled by Hamas , the Islamic Resistance Movement, since 2007. By 15 January 2024, the death toll in Gaza was more than 24,000 . Some of the Israelis taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023 had not been released . The video of the collapsing stage, supposedly as a result of an imam's antisemitic statement, can be found here , here , here , here , here , here and here , with one posted to a public Facebook group with over 105,000 members. But did the man make such a comment and did the stage collapse as a result? We checked. Video is old, not related to Israel-Hamas conflict Using the video analysis tool Invid , Africa Check found that the video has been online since at least 2018. Voice of America shared the video on Facebook on 18 July of that year, with a caption that a stage had collapsed during an election rally held in Pakistan. Africa Check then searched for news reports of the event and found the same video posted on X (formerly Twitter) on the same day by Aditya Raj Kaul , a journalist . Emir Sirajul Haq and other leaders of the religious political party Jamaat-e-Islami fell when the stage collapsed due to overcrowding . The incident took place in Pakistan's Mohmand tribal district. India Today, an India-based online magazine, reported that the imam was speaking Urdu, a language spoken in Pakistan and India. The imam was reportedly welcoming the leaders to the rally before the stage collapsed. This is not the first time the video has been posted with the same false claim. In September 2018, a Facebook user also claimed that an Islamic preacher had made an antisemitic comment, causing the stage to collapse. Antisemitic or other incendiary incidents should be taken seriously, especially during a time of war. By separating true statements from false ones, the fact-checking process can help ensure that appropriate action, such as condemning antisemitic comments, is taken.",

        "doc": "As companies in Kenya are usually taxed on their profits, this often results in a lower effective tax rate for them, leading to a perception of inequality in the tax burden. But experts say simply comparing personal and corporate income taxes is like comparing apples and oranges, as many other factors are at play. The publication was however right that six out of 10 small businesses in Kenya have defaulted, and foreign investors have exited in droves. In November 2023, Kenyan political magazine the Weekly Review gave p resident William Ruto a failing grade for his handling of the economy. \"E for Economy\" was the bold headline . The magazine is published by the newspaper with the largest circulation in the country, the Nation. The kicker below the headline in a version of the cover that did the rounds online had more details. It read: \"A majority of Kenyans living in the hand-to-mouth informal sector pay higher personal income tax than corporate bodies. About 60% of SMEs are in default, while 42% of foreign investors have fled the NSE. The nation is in dire straits.\" SMEs are small and medium enterprises, while the NSE is the Nairobi Securities Exchange , the country's financial marketplace. The editor of the Weekly Review told Africa Check that this version was the authentic front page. In it, the kicker gave less detailed reasons for the poor grade, including unpopular tax policies and investors voting with their feet. We checked the text of the full article published online (behind a paywall) and found that it contained the more detailed claims in the version being shared online. So we took a closer look at four of these. The paywalled article questioned why poor Kenyans who earn a living in the informal sector pay higher taxes on their personal income than companies. The International Labour Organization defines the informal economy as workers or enterprises that are not covered, or are insufficiently covered, by official rules. This is either because the laws do not apply to them or because they do not fully comply with them. The Institute of Economic Affairs-Kenya , an economic thinktank, says that the informal sector in Kenya is generally considered \"as comprising of activities of petty traders \u2026 involved in the sale of second-hand items like clothes, shoe shining, street vendors, carpentry, vegetable selling, repair and construction work\". In a 2021 report , the Federation of Kenya Employers defined informal enterprises as unregistered businesses. The employers' lobby also defined an informal worker as one who did not have a contract, written or oral, did not have paid time off or work-provided health benefits, and whose employer did not contribute to social security or health insurance. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics publishes annual economic surveys that include employment data. The most recent survey found that the \"informal sector \u2026remains the main source of employment for the working population\" in Kenya. It showed that of an estimated 19.1 million people in employment, 15.96 million were in the informal sector. The informal sector thus accounted for 83.6% of total employment. This figure does not include those engaged in small-scale agriculture or pastoralist activities. By law, the basic monthly minimum wage is between KSh18,862 and KSh23,868 (US$120 and $150), depending on location. Those in urban areas are paid more than those in rural areas. Furthermore, in Kenya, any adult who spends a maximum of KSh3,252 per month in the rural areas, and KSh5,995 in urban areas, is considered poor . But do these informal sector workers pay more income tax and non-value added tax than companies? Perception of inequality around taxation of companies Maurice Lugongo , a senior manager for tax and legal at Deloitte Kenya , explained the nuances of taxation in the country. Individuals paid taxes based on their gross income, while companies paid their corporate taxes on their income after deducting various business-related expenses, he told Africa Check. According to the Kenya Revenue Authority, personal income tax is levied on a sliding scale of between 10% and 35%, while corporate income tax is levied on profits at a flat rate of 30% for Kenyan companies and 37.5% for foreign companies. \"It may not be 100% true that [individuals] are taxed more heavily, from an income tax perspective, than corporate bodies,\" Lugongo said. For example, an individual earning up to KSh288,000 a year pays tax at 10%, while a Kenyan company pays corporate tax at 30% on profits only. However, as companies are usually taxed on their profits, this often results in a lower effective tax rate for them, leading to a perception of inequality in the tax burden. Put simply, comparing personal and corporate income taxes is misleading. Because of the differences in how the taxes are designed and what they're based on, it's like trying to compare apples and oranges. Moreover, with the maximum minimum wage at KSh23,868 per month (or KSh286,416 per year), the majority of informal sector workers who do pay tax are taxed at 10%. In addition, informal sector workers often find it difficult to pay income tax due to irregular income streams, lack of formal documentation as payments are often made in cash and off the books, and limited enforcement mechanisms. Companies, as registered business entities, don't have such loopholes. The claim is misleading . The Weekly Review article said that at 11% of total tax revenue, corporate taxes in Kenya are already among the lowest in the world, compared to 31 African countries, for which it gave a figure of 19%. ( Note: The article incorrectly gave the percentage as a share of gross domestic product [GDP], rather than of total revenue as given in the OECD source it cited. ) It continued: \"Personal income tax and taxes other than VAT (value-added tax) are higher in Kenya than the average in 31 African countries.\" The author cited his earlier article , published on 26 February 2023, which quoted revenue statistics from the African Union and the European Union . He said the figures came from the Organisation for Cooperation and Development (OECD). That first article cited the data correctly. The OECD's Revenue Statistics in Africa 2023 document shows that Kenya's taxes amounted to 15.2% of GDP in 2021, the 15th highest of the 33 African countries surveyed. The average ratio of tax revenue to GDP for the 33 countries was 15.6%. The World Bank says that countries should raise revenues equivalent to at least 15% of GDP to meet the basic needs of citizens and businesses. The data also shows that in Kenya, personal income tax accounted for 22% of all taxes collected in 2021, compared to 11% for corporate tax. So how does Kenya compare to other African countries for corporate and income tax? Kenya among the highest for personal income From the OECD's global revenue statistics database , we extracted data on the two tax items as a proportion of total revenue for 32 African countries, including Kenya. Although Eswatini appears in the database, the query did not return any data. ( Note: See Excel files from the database. ) The data showed that in 2021, Kenya had the ninth highest personal income tax revenue as a proportion of total revenue, at 22.1%. The countries with the highest personal income tax as a share of revenue were Lesotho (41.3%), Namibia (40.6%), Malawi and Sierra Leone (both 32.2%), and South Africa (32.1%). The lowest ratios were found in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (0.4%), Guinea (5.9%) and Mali (6.6%). Country among the lowest for corporate income For corporate income as a share of total tax revenues, Kenya ranked 26th , with 11%. The highest were Equatorial Guinea (56.9%), Nigeria (35%) and Chad 32%. Kenya was among the lowest, ahead of Tunisia (7.1%), Cape Verde (8.3%), Congo (8.4%), Uganda (8.8%) and Guinea (9.4%). Kenya's 11% corporate tax rate is also lower than the 19% average for the African countries surveyed, as the author notes elsewhere in the article . The data supports the claim. In September 2023, mainstream newspapers in Kenya reported that 60% of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) had defaulted on loans. The publications cited an August 2023 survey by the Central Bank of Kenya , the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics and non-profit the Financial Sector Deepening Trust . The survey defined micro-enterprises as those with fewer than 10 employees and an annual turnover of less than KSh1 million. Small enterprises were those with between 10 and 50 employees and an annual turnover of between KSh1 million and KSh5 million. The survey found that 60.7% of these businesses had defaulted on their loans by June 2023, up from 42.8% in October 2022, Ruto's first full month as Kenyan president. The claim is supported by the most recent credible data. The Weekly Review cited the central bank's most recent financial stability report , published in September 2023. \"Foreign investors at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) continued to offload their portfolio holding,\" the report said . It added that investor flight could partly explain \"exchange rate depreciations as foreign investors continue to exit or stay away from the NSE, thus weakening it further\". For the exact figures, we checked with the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), which regulates the securities market. The CMA publishes quarterly statistical bulletins summarising investor profiles and numbers. Ruto was inaugurated in September 2022. At the end of that month, the third quarter of the year, the regulator's data showed that there were 1,095 foreign corporate investors and 13,769 foreign individual investors in the stock market \u2013 a total of 14,864. There were also eight foreign corporate investors and 26 foreign individual investors in the bond market, making a total of 34. This brought the total number of foreign investors to 14,898 as of September 2022. The latest report for the third quarter of 2023 shows that there were 451 foreign corporate investors and 8,170 individual corporate investors in the stock market \u2013 a total of 8,621. In the bond market, there were seven foreign corporate investors and 24 foreign individual investors. The total number of foreign investors in September 2023 was 8,652. The number of foreign investors fell from 14,898 to 8,652, a decrease of 6,246 investors or 42% between the end of September 2022 and September 2023. We therefore rate the claim as correct.",

The World Food Programme (WFP) is looking to employ more than 50,000 people. That's the claim made in a post on Facebook in January 2024. As part of the United Nations , the WFP focuses on humanitarian activities such as delivering food to people in need. The post reads, in part: \"MASS RECRUITMENT FOR WFP JOBS WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME (WFP). The RECRUITMENT form is available and recruitment has begun for all interested persons between the ages of 18 and 40 More than 50,000 job opportunities. All nationalities are eligible to apply\u2026\" The post includes a link for those interested in applying for the jobs. The claim has also been posted elsewhere on Facebook. But is the agency looking to hire tens of thousands of people? We checked. Engagement bait scam Clicking on the link will take you to a website ( archived here ), with the WFP logo. However, it does not list the vacancies. Instead, it provides an application form. The form asks applicants to provide personal information such as their name, telephone number, email address, country and state of residence. After completing this, the applicant will be asked to validate their name to proceed to the next step, where they will be asked to provide their full name and their level of education. They will then be asked to share their link with five groups or 15 friends via WhatsApp. Only if they follow these instructions will their application be successful, according to the site. This is characteristic of engagement bait: applicants are asked to share or comment to increase the reach of the post, but no real reward is offered. This also directs traffic to the site. Africa Check has investigated similar types of links in the past. The official WFP website , which has a different address than the one used in the posts in question, does not mention such a large recruitment drive. WFP warns of scams On the careers section of its website, the humanitarian organisation warns the public about fake job offers circulating via email, social media or online job boards. \"Many of these schemes consist of an alleged offer of employment or contract with WFP in return for the payment of fees or the providing of personal or banking information,\" it said . \"WFP only advertises its employment opportunities on its global employment website or uses bona fide and established media, newspapers and online job boards to advertise its vacancies. Official communications from the World Food Programme will always come from emails ending in @wfp.org.\" An important clue that the link in the Facebook posts is not authentic is that the WFP employs about 23,000 people worldwide ; it's unlikely that it would want to hire 50,000 more.

        "doc": "'Crime has decreased by 21%' Claim \"The overall crime rate has decreased by 21 % since 2002\u2026\" Verdict misleading The decrease in the overall crime rate claimed by Zuma referred only to the period from 2002/03 to 2011/12. It excluded the 2012/13 crime statistics which showed worrying increases in a number of categories of serious and violent crime. On the face of it, Zuma's claim appeared to have been supported by a 2012 factsheet prepared by South Africa's Institute for Security Studies which stated that \"[s]ince the 2002/03 financial year, when total crime levels peaked in South Africa, the overall crime rate has decreased by 21%\". But the fact-sheet also pointedly cautioned that overall crime rates do not provide useful information in terms of increases or decreases in specific crime categories, with respect to regional crime rate changes, or the reasons for the change in crime rates. Without this context, the victory-against-crime claim recycled by the president last year was almost meaningless. Zuma's claim used 2002 \u2013 a year in which \"total crime levels peaked in South Africa\" \u2013 as its benchmark. While overall crime rates may have decreased by 21% between 2002 and 2012, the ISS noted that \"overall levels of crime [for 2011/2012] are actually quite comparable with the levels recorded in 1994/1995\". The decline in crime was not uninterrupted. According to the ISS, a \"3% increase in total crime levels was recorded in the two-year period between 2007/08 and 2009/10\", which was followed by marginal decreases in the next two years. Gareth Newham, the head of the ISS's governance, crime and justice division said last year that Zuma's address should have focused on \"what has happened in the last year, not distracting us by discussing the last ten years\". \"In the last year all forms of serious and violent crimes \u2013 including murder, attempted murder, house robbery, street robbery \u2013 all of these have increased. Murder is of particular concern, because the [murder rate] had been coming down \u2013 and this is the first time murder has increased in seven years.\" 'Progress made in reducing serious crime' Claim \"Some progress has been made over the past five years in reducing the levels of serious crime such as murders, aggravated robberies, crimes against women, children and other vulnerable groups, but they remain unacceptably high. We will work to further reduce levels of crime.\" Verdict misleading An analysis of the 2012/13 crime statistics showed that \"violent crimes that cause the most fear and trauma amongst the public\" had increased in 2012/13. For the first time in six years there had been an increase in both the number and rate of murders and attempted murders. Incidents of murder increased from 15,609 murders in 2011/12 to 16,259 murders in 2012/13 . Consequently, the number of murders increased from a total average of 43 murders a day to 45 murders per day. There were also increases in attempted murders, aggravated robbery, residential burglary, fraud, vehicle hijackings and theft from motor vehicles. Averaged out over five years, the official crime statistics certainly showed an overall reduction in serious crimes, as claimed by the president. But his statement failed to mention the 2012/13 crime statistics which \u2013 for the first time in six years \u2013 showed disturbing increases in violent crimes including murder, attempted murder, residential burglaries, aggravated robberies and vehicle hijackings.

        "doc": "Did 1.2 million black people earn more than R400,000 in 2014? Are social grants the main source of income for 40% of black households? And did the percentage of black judges increase by 248% between 2000 and 2012? These were some of the claims made by the head of South Africa's Free Market Foundation . Leon Louw wrote that \"despite the fact that there has been a spectacular amount of transformation [in South Africa], the established consensus is that little has changed and that whites still own everything\". President of the Progressive Professionals Forum, Jimmy Manyi, quoted many of the claims verbatim in a City Press opinion piece. Editor of the Financial Mail, Tim Cohen, shared the article on Twitter , calling it a \"tour-de-force by Leon Louw\". But when Africa Check wrote to Louw asking for evidence to support the claims, it took him six weeks to provide a list of sources , but most of them did not support his claims or contained contradictory claims. He did not provide any evidence for four claims. According to Louw \"almost everything you ever read or hear about what share of something blacks or whites have is false\". So far Africa Check has found a lot of Louw's claims to be false too. Income Claim \"The number of black people earning more than R400,000 a year grew 1,000% from 120,000 to 1.2 million between 2000 and last year; 90% are in the private sector.\" Verdict unproven Africa Check was unable to find any evidence that supported this claim. South African Revenue Service (SARS) spokesman, Sandile Memela, told Africa Check that SARS is unable to provide a racial breakdown of taxpayers. \"Race is also not a question posed on individual tax returns. Furthermore ID numbers since the mid 1990's  no longer carry the race of taxpayers and it is therefore not possible from SARS records to provide the breakdown as requested,\" said Memela. SARS has a breakdown of individuals by income groups dating back to 2003 . In 2003 there were 76,954 taxpayers who earned more than R400,000 per year. In 2015 the tax groupings changed and SARS no longer has a bracket for people who earn more than R400,000 a year. Their new brackets show that in 2014 1,199,990 taxpayers earned more than R300,000 per year and 480,435 taxpayer's earned more than R500,000 a year. Based on this information, Memela said it was \"unlikely\" that 1.2 million black people earned more than R400,000 in 2014, as just under 1.2 million people \u2013 of all races \u2013 earned over R300,000 that year. A smaller number will have earned more than R400,000 per year and not all of them will have been black South Africans. However, the SARS statistics will exclude people who either evade or avoid tax. \"The key issue is that the statistics refer only to taxable income declared and the position of a number of individuals may be different,\" national head of tax practice at law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, Emil Brincker, told Africa Check. Property ownership Claim \"Latter-day racists who demand coercive land redistribution do not know that black buying has grown to 50% of all voluntary transactions.\" Verdict unproven The source provided by the Free Market Foundation, First National Banks' Estate Agent Survey for last year, states that buying in \"former white suburban areas\" by \"previously disadvantaged\" population groups comprised 49.2% of total buying in 2014 - with white people's share making up the rest. The report did not explain FNB's methodology. Asked by Africa Check, the bank's household and property sector strategist, John Loos, said that they survey 150 estate agents in South Africa's six metropolitan areas each quarter. \"We don't ask for the number of buyers or transactions,\" Loos explained. \"Rather, we ask them to provide an estimated percentage of buyers that they experience to be 'black', 'coloured\u2026' etc.\" The survey is not nationally representative and is based on estate agents' opinions, not transaction data. As Africa Check previously reported , South African title deeds do not list the race of owners since 1994, making it impossible to calculate the actual share of black property buying. Judiciary Claim \"The percentage of black judges increased 248% from 25% to 62% between 2000 and 2012.\" Verdict incorrect As it stands, the claim is mathematically incorrect. The percentage increase from 25% to 62% is 148% - not 248%. To prove his claim, Louw's office sent Africa Check a link to a May 2013 article by deputy minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, Andries Nel, who wrote that 62% of judges were black , including coloured and Indian judges. This is also the share stated in the department's 2012/13 annual report . But using these figures, the claim is still incorrect. In 2000/01, 30% of judges were black , coloured or Indian. The increase between then and 2012/13 is 107% - not 248%. Literacy Claim \"Youth illiteracy is nearly nonexistent at 4%.\" Verdict incorrect Verdict: Incorrect To support this claim, Louw provided a presentation which contained an unreferenced and undated claim that \"youth literacy\" was 2% - not 4% as he claimed in the article. South Africa's National Youth Policy defines the youth as people aged 14 to 35. In 2014 the General Household Survey reported that there were 21.5 million people in this age group. Service delivery statistics manager at Stats SA, Ni\u00ebl Roux, previously told Africa Check that the survey measures literacy through self-assessment, not a literacy test. Respondents are classified as illiterate when they report that they have a lot of difficulty reading and writing, or are unable to read or write. According to this assessment, 1.5% of South Africa's youth were illiterate. Stats SA also releases an estimate of how many people are \"functionally literate\", which refers to people who have completed at least Grade 7 of schooling. People with this level of schooling are believed to have a \" level of reading and writing which adults are thought to need in modern complex society \". According to this definition, 12.5% of youth were considered functionally illiterate in 2014. Share of ownership Claim: \"Blacks are approaching or have surpassed 50% in almost everything\u2026\" 1) Medical aid membership Verdict: Correct South Africa's Council for Medical Schemes reported that in 2014 the country had 8,814,458 medical scheme members . The council is a statutory body that regulates and supervises private health financing through medical schemes. However, the council's general manager for stakeholder relations, Elsab\u00e9 Conradie, told Africa Check that they did not collect information on the race of scheme members. Data extracted from Stats SA's 2014 General Household Survey shows that an estimated 9,624,786 people in South Africa were \"covered by a medical aid or medical benefit scheme or other private health insurance\" that year. Of these, 47% were African/black, 36% were white, 10% were coloured and 7% were Indian/Asian. Conradie said the Stats SA estimate was higher because it included a number of other health care insurance products. 2) Credit cards Verdict: Unsubstantiated Louw cited Vivian Atud, who was previously an economist at the Free Market Foundation. Atud told Africa Check her research was based on \"public information and other privately sourced information\". She said she would send us a copy of a study to support the claims, but at the time of publishing we had not received it. In the meantime, Africa Check tried to find other data on the racial breakdown of credit card ownership in South Africa. Both South Africa's National Credit Regulator and the South African Reserve Bank said that they did not have such information. The bank's media coordinator, Candice Jeffreys, advised Africa Check to approach commercial banks for the information. We checked with Standard Bank, but spokesman Ross Linstrom said the bank does not require people to disclose their race when applying for a credit card. Welfare Claim \"Social grants are the main source of income for 40% of black households.\" Verdict incorrect Louw said the source for the claim was the South African Institute for Race Relations , but did not provide further details. Data from Stats SA's 2014 General Household Survey found that a total of 46.5% of black households receive grants. Service delivery statistics manager at Stats SA, Ni\u00ebl Roux, told Africa Check that less than a quarter (24.3%) of black households were dependent on grants as their primary source of income.

Africa Check wasted little time in putting his claims under the microscope. Claim \"The matric pass rate increased from 60.6 percent in 2009 to 75.1 percent last year.\" Verdict correct In 2009, minister of basic education, Angie Motshekga, announced that South Africa's matric pass rate was 60.6%. The most recent pass rate, from 2017, was 75.1%. \u2013 Kate Wilkinson GUIDE: Assessing South Africa's schooling system Claim \"There are currently almost one million students who are enrolled in higher education, up from 500,000 in 1994.\" Verdict correct In 1994, there were 525,000 students enrolled in higher education institutions in South Africa. This included students at historically black universities and technikons, historically white universities and technikons and distance providers. The latest audited data on higher education enrollment in South Africa is for 2015. It shows that there were 985,212 students enrolled in 26 public higher education institutions. - Kate Wilkinson FACTSHEET: Funding & the changing face of SA's public universities Claim \"The Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative programme continues to deliver modern facilities to our schools... with at least 187 schools being completed to date. \" Verdict correct The department of basic education replaces unsafe and \"inappropriate\" school structures under the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi) programme which started in 2011. The most recent data from the department shows that 187 schools have been completed under the programme. It has fallen far behind its targets, however. In 2011, the programme identified 496 schools that were considered \"inappropriate structures\" and needed to be replaced by March 2014. These included schools built from mud. The first 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, followed by 100 schools in 2012/13 and 346 schools in 2013/14. Ramaphosa promised that the programme \"will complete all outstanding projects by the end of the next financial year\", which would be 31 March 2019. \u2013 Kate Wilkinson READ: Where are the receipts for 795 schools Zuma says SA government built? Claim \"Our state employs some one million public servants.\" Verdict incorrect Between 2001/02 and 2011/12, employment in South Africa's national and provincial departments grew rapidly. It peaked at 1.33 million full-time equivalent positions in 2012/13, data from the 2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement showed. The figures are given as \"full-time equivalents\" to account for part-time positions, the head of Wits University's School of Economic and Business Sciences, Prof Jannie Rossouw, told Africa Check. Since then, public service employment has levelled out, Rossouw added. For the 2016/17 financial year, it stood at 1,304,600. The medium policy statement notes that employees from the Community Work Programme and the Expanded Public Works Programme are not included in the figures, as \"they are not part of the public service\". \u2013 Anim van Wyk Financial year Full-time equivalent public servants 2006-07 1,128,909 2007-08 1,139,005 2008-09 1,210,782 2009-10 1,246,680 2010-11 1,275,125 2011-12 1,311,136 2012-13 1,326,120 2013-14 1,319,567 2014-15 1,313,209 2015-16 1,310,729 2016-17 1,304,600 Claim \"Poverty levels rose in 2015\" Verdict correct South Africa has three official poverty lines: the food poverty line (R441 per person per month in 2015 prices), the lower-bound poverty line (R647) and the upper-bound poverty line (R992). In 2006, 66.6% of South Africa's population were living in poverty (under the upper-bound poverty line). This fell to to 62.1% in 2009 and dropped further to 53.2% in 2011. This decreasing trend ended in 2015, when the proportion of people living in poverty increased to 55.5% . - Kate Wilkinson READ: FACTSHEET: South Africa's official poverty numbers Claim \"Since the start of the current parliament, our public employment programmes have created more than 3.2 million work opportunities.\" Verdict correct Data from the Expanded Public Works Programme show that between the 2014/2015 financial year to 30 September 2017 (the latest data provided by the department of public works ) 3,216,382 work opportunities have been created. Period Number of work opportunities 1 April - 30 September 2017 591,614 2016/2017 779,245 2015/2016 741,540 2014/2015 1,103,983 Total 3,216,382 Work opportunities are not permanent jobs, though, and only last a few months in most instances. The department also has a rider that \"the same individual can be employed on different projects and each period of employment will be counted as a work opportunity \". So while more than 3.2 million work opportunities were created, this does not mean that a similar number of people benefited from the programme. \u2013 Gopolang Makou Claim \"Today we have nearly one million children who are participating in early childhood development facilities. \" Verdict incorrect Africa Check previously rated this claim as \"correct\" based on information from the department of basic education. But new research suggests that Ramaphosa's figure of \"nearly 1 million children\" is a significant underestimate. According to Martin Gustafsson , an economics researcher at the University of Stellenbosch , there are \" widespread misperceptions around how many children in South Africa attend some form of ECD institution\". He has researched and written extensively on the economics of education and pre-school participation . Gustafsson used data from Statistics South Africa's 2016 mid-year population estimates and 2016 Community Survey to estimate the number of children in any type of pre-school in 2016. (Note: These were children who were younger than eight at the start of 2016.) His calculations put the figure at 2,409,953 children . But he did add that this could be an over- or underestimation. The figure would be an underestimate if parents told Stats SA that their children where were \"in a school\" when they were actually at an early childhood development (ECD) facility. It would be an overestimate if parents reported \"day mother\" services, in which someone else looks after a single child during the day, as an ECD facility. \"Even with such a margin of error, it is clear that commonly quoted figures for ECD participation are much too low,\" Gustafsson said. \u2013 Kate Wilkinson Claim \"More than 17 million social grants are paid each month\" Verdict correct In December 2017, some 17,347,263 social grants were paid out according to the most recent data from South Africa Social Security Agency 's (SASSA). By far most of these were child support grants, accounting for 12,197,673. Grant type Number Old age grant 3,380,904 War veteran's grant 125 Disability grant 1,065,536 Grant in aid 184,696 Care dependency grant 146,666 Foster child grant 371,643 Child support grant 12,197,673 Total 17,347,263 The agency's data shows that more than 17 million grants were made in each month of 2017. \u2013 Gopolang Makou READ : FACTSHEET: Social grants in South Africa \u2013 separating myth from reality Claim \"Government's free basic services programme currently supports more than 3.5 million indigent households.\" Verdict correct Statistics South Africa released its latest non-financial census of municipalities in May 2017. It showed that in 2016, a total of 3,564,866 households received some form of support from government's free basic services programme. Province Indigent households identified by the municipalities (2016) Western Cape 386,695 Eastern Cape 769,176 Northern Cape 80,166 Free State 143,115 KwaZulu-Natal 757,405 North West 185,399 Gauteng 697,234 Mpumalanga 168,190 Limpopo 377,486 South Africa 3,564,866 This is an increase of 16%, or 584,346 households, compared to the 2,980,520 households who received this support in 2015. \u2013 Gopolang Makou READ: FACTSHEET: South Africa's official poverty numbers Claim Mining fatalities are rising Verdict correct \"We are extremely concerned about the rising fatalities in mining, particularly this year,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that \"one mining fatality is far too many\". Data from the department of mineral resources shows that mining fatalities had been decreasing since 2004, when they stood at 246. By 2016, they had dropped to 73. However, the trend reversed in 2017, with preliminary figures showing 83 people died in the country's mines. This Adv Paul Mardon, deputy general secretary for Occupational Health and Safety at trade union Solidarity , shared with Africa Check. Year Mining fatalities 2004 246 2005 201 2006 200 2007 220 2008 171 2009 168 2010 127 2011 123 2012 112 2013 93 2014 84 2015 77 2016 73 2017 83* Source : Chamber of Mines & Solidarity And the negative trend seems to continue, Mardon explained, as 12 miners have already died this year, compared to 10 in the same period in 2017. \"Both mines and miners are taking short-cuts and working faster to chase production targets at the expense of safety,\" he said. \"Unions, mining houses and government need to start working together instead of each doing their own thing.\" \u2013 Anim van Wyk Claim \"Agriculture has made the largest contribution\u2026 to the improved growth of our economy in the second and third quarters of 2017.\" Verdict correct The economic growth of a country can be measured in different ways, according to Statistics South Africa . The most commonly used measure is real gross domestic product (GDP). This is the \"total value of goods and services that are produced in an economy in a certain time period\". The figures are adjusted to remove the effects of inflation and allow for comparison over time. 2nd quarter 2017 The largest positive contributor to economic growth in the second quarter of 2017 was the agriculture, forestry and fishing industry. During that period, it contributed 0.7 of a percentage point to GDP growth (at constant 2010 prices, seasonally adjusted and annualised). Statistics South Africa noted that \"the industry's increase was mainly as a result of increases in the production of field crops and horticultural products\". The second biggest contributor was finance, real estate and business services (half a percentage point), followed by the mining and quarrying industry (0.3 of a percentage point). 3rd quarter 2017 The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry was again the largest contributor to economic growth, contributing 0.9 of a percentage point . Both the mining and quarrying industry and the manufacturing industry contributed 0.5 of a percentage point to GDP growth respectively. \u2013 Kate Wilkinson Claim \"Tourism currently sustains 700,000 direct jobs\" Verdict correct The latest tourism factsheet from the department of tourism notes that the industry contributed 731,398 jobs directly to the South African economy in the second quarter of 2017. The deputy director-general for tourism research, policy and international relations at the department, Aneme Malan, told Africa Check the figures are informed by Stats SA's methodology. \"The department uses the Quarterly Labour Force Survey and applies the same ratios used to calculate direct jobs created through tourism,\" Malan noted. She added that these figures would include both seasonal and permanent employment. Stats SA compiles annual job figures in their Tourism Satellite Account report, Desiree Manamela, a labour statistics director with the official data agency , told Africa Check. Figures for 2016 are due out soon. The previous three reports showed a steady increase in people employed to produce goods and services for visitors. - Gopolang Makou Year Tourism-related jobs 2015 711,746 * 2014 679,560* 2013 657,766 Source: Tourism Satellite Account (* preliminary figures)",

        "doc": "In his response to the State of the Nation Address , Democratic Alliance parliamentary leader Mmusi Maimane made a number of claims about electricity, employment, land reform and crime. Here are the claims that readers asked us to investigate. Electricity Claim \"Our economy has lost R300-billion since 2008 because, without a stable electricity supply, manufacturers cannot produce, investors are driven away and jobs are lost.\" Verdict mostly-correct The Democratic Alliance obtained the R300-billion estimate from economist Dawie Roodt, chief economist at the Efficient Group , a JSE-listed financial services company. Maimane's chief of staff, Andr\u00e9 Coetzee, told Africa Check: \"We engaged with Roodt on the methodology underlying his assertions and were satisfied that they were sound. His office also provided the technical data on which the figures were calculated for our researchers to review.\" Francois Stofberg, an economist at the Efficient Group, told Africa Check that they used different approaches in an attempt to \"determine what the impact of a shortage of electricity supply is on the South African economy\". He explained that this included a \"linear... forecast of economic growth before and after the electricity crisis\". \"Using this method we found that the economy would have been 10% larger in 2013 [ when GDP stood at R3,400-billion ] without the black-outs that occurred during the latter parts of 2007. Note that this excludes the recent black-outs,\" Stofberg said. He said that many other variables in the economy could have had a positive or negative effect on South Africa's economic growth. These, he said, were difficult to quantify. \"However, it is evident from our estimates that a shortage of electricity... had a significant impact on GDP. Our estimates were an attempt to quantify these impacts,\" said Stofberg. He added that \"[n]one of these approaches are without criticism\". The head of Wits University's School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw, said that estimates like this would be influenced by the assumptions made by the economists. \"Naturally other assumptions will give other results, but [the Efficient Group's] assumptions are sound enough,\" said Rossouw. Employment Claim \"Despite all his past promises, what President Zuma failed to tell us last week was that, today, there are 1.6-million more South Africans without jobs than when he took office in 2009.\" Verdict incorrect [Note: This section was corrected on 22 January 2016, but the verdict has stayed the same. An explanation of the correction is provided at the end of the report.] The figure of 1.6-million was calculated based on what they viewed as the broad unemployment rate, a s released in Statistics South Africa's Quarterly Labour Force Survey, Coetzee told Africa Check. This definition of employment includes both unemployed people and discouraged job seekers . He provided a table showing the figures they had used from the survey, which compared data from April to June of 2009 (when Zuma took office) with October to December of 2014. This, Coetzee said, showed that the number of unemployed people increased by 1.67-million \u2013 from 5.64-million in the second quarter of 2009 to 7.31-million at the end of the 2014 . However, while the DA used the right definition of broad unemployment (unemployed people plus discouraged job seekers) they used data from Stats SA's calculation of people unemployed according to the narrow definition. Instead they should have used Stats SA's dataset on the number of people employed according to the broad unemployment definition. This shows that the number of unemployed people increased from 6.68 million in April to June of 2009 to 8.1 million in October to December of 2014 . Using the broad unemployment dataset, the number of unemployed people has therefore increased by by 1.42 million since Zuma took office, not 1.6-million as Maimane claimed. Land reform Claim \"The 17.5 million hectares of fertile soil in communal land areas must be unlocked for reform purposes. State-owned land must be fully audited and used to fast-track redistribution to deserving beneficiaries.\" Verdict incorrect Land reform numbers are tricky . Few accurate datasets exist and some of them are very outdated. Take the land utilisation data set that forms the basis of Maimane's claim. Although still in use by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, it was compiled in 1991. (An updated version should be released towards the end of next year, said the department's spokesman, Makenosi Maro.) The 1991 data showed that in the former apartheid-era homelands there were 2.5-million hectares of potentially arable land and 12-million ha of grazing land. Together with all other land uses \u2013 such as for nature conservation, forestry and towns \u2013 this amounted to 17.1-million hectares in total. To their credit, the DA admitted this large error. Coetzee said: \"The reference to the full area as comprising fertile soil is erroneous in this context, however the need for tenure reform for the areas remaining under communal land tenure remains and would unlock massive agricultural potential for land reform beneficiaries.\" But it is a fallacy to think there are millions of hectares of state land ready to be redistributed, said Alex Dubb, a researcher at the University of the Western Cape's Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS). Dubb helped compile a factsheet on state land available for redistribution based on 2002 data and their calculations then showed that only 675,449 ha could possibly be redistributed. In the meantime a state land audit has been carried out and government is busy registering all its properties uncovered during the process with the Deeds Office. Once this has been carried out, we will have a much better picture of how much state land is available for redistribution and how much municipal land is available as commonage to poor households. Crime Claim \"But while our communities are being over-run by drug lords the President said nothing about crime! Where are the specialised anti-drug units? Drug crime has doubled since they were taken away.\" Verdict incorrect Our verdict: Incorrect Andr\u00e9 Coetzee, Maimane's chief of staff, told Africa Check that \"anti-drug units were disbanded in 2004, and drug-related crime has more than doubled between 2004 and 2013\". He said this was based on the 2013 Crime Statistics released by the South African Police Service. According to the South African Police Service, reported drug-related crime has tripled since 2004. The latest crime statistics show that there were 84,001 cases in 2004/05 and 260,732 cases in 2013/14. The drug-related crime ratio increased 2.7 times over the same period from 180.3 cases per 100,000 people in 2004/05 to 492.1 cases per 100,000 people in 2013/14. Ratios allow for crime levels to be accurately compared between different years in which population sizes vary. But an increase in the reported number of drug-related crimes does not automatically mean that these crimes are on the rise. A factsheet prepared by the Institute for Security Studies for Africa Check noted that \"[c]rimes such as the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, drug-related crime and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs are detected during police action such as roadblocks and search and seizure operations. This means that these crimes will increase if there is an increase in police activity.\" Additional reporting by Anim van Wyk",

        "doc": "In his 2019 State of Devolution Address, council of governors chair Wycliffe Oparanya made three claims on revenue allocation to counties, two claims each on healthcare and agriculture, and a claim on gender equality in county governments. Two of the claims on revenue were correct, as were claims about gender equality and healthcare facilities. One claim about agriculture was mostly correct, and the other incorrect. A third claim on revenue was also mostly correct, but a claim on healthcare budgets was incorrect. On 28 June Kenya's county governors issued the 2019 State of Devolution Address in which they laid out the achievements of the 47 county governments in agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, budgeting and gender equality. The statement was released amid a revenue war between Kenya's senate and national assembly, at a time when the country was rethinking the counties' share of national revenue. The address was delivered by Wycliffe Oparanya, chair of the council of governors and governor of Kakamega County , two days before the end of the 2018/19 financial year. In the statement he celebrated that counties were allocating more money to development. But do his claims add up? We checked. Claim \"County governments have allocated on average 6.7 % of their total budgets to the agriculture sector.\" Verdict mostly-correct Africa Check asked Ruth Chitwa, the council of governors' acting director of communications, for the source of the data. She referred us to the council's monitoring and evaluation team, who asked us to send an email with our queries. But despite repeated reminders, we have not yet received a response. ( Note: We will update this report should we do so. ) In his address, Oparanya said the counties were aware of their crucial role in achieving food and nutrition security for Kenya, which was why they had increased funding for agriculture. Budget allocations for the 47 county governments are captured in reports by the controller of budget , who authorises all government spending. The annual county budget implementation review report for the 2017/18 financial year and the latest half-year report for 2018/19 contain each county's budget allocations to agriculture. From the reports' line item allocations to agriculture, we calculated that counties set aside 5.6% of their budgets to agriculture in 2017/18, and 6.3% in the first six months of 2018/19. The most recent publicly available data shows that counties gave 6.3% of their total budgets to agriculture. Oparanya said the share was 6.7%. We rate his claim as mostly correct. (Note: The latest economic survey shows that in 2017/18, counties spent KSh11.8 billion on agriculture out of KSh336.4 billion in total spending. This is just 3.5% of the total. In 2018/19, the projected expenditure on agriculture is KSh27.8 billion out of a total of KSh459.5 billion. This is 6.1% of the total.) \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim \"This is just 3% less of the 10% recommended allocation [for agriculture] as per the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) Malabo declaration.\" Verdict misleading In 2004, 44 members of the African Union resolved to set aside \"at least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture.'' In the 2014 Malabo declaration , the AU upheld the commitment for \"at least 10% of public expenditure\" to go to agriculture. This was to boost economies and improve food security. In his address , Oparanya said Kenyan counties could achieve the 10% investment in agriculture \"if the devolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are released to counties\". Kenya's 2010 constitution makes agriculture a \"devolved function\", a responsibility of the counties. In 2017/18, counties allocated an estimated KSh23 billion to agriculture out of an estimated total budget of KSh411.6 billion \u2013 about 5.6%. A 10% allocation would have been KSh41.1 billion. In 2018/19, agriculture's share rose to KSh29.1 billion (6.3%) out of a total of KSh462.1 billion. A 10% allocation would have been KSh46.2 billion. This works out to a difference of just over three percentage points. But the difference between the 2018/19 allocation of KSh29.1 billion and the Malabo aspiration of at least 10% of the total county budget (KSh46.2 billion) works out to a gap of 37%, not 3%. We therefore rate Oparanya's claim as misleading. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim \"We experienced an increase in the number of functional health facilities growing from 9,858 to 10,820 in 2018 across all counties. Verdict correct The latest economic survey shows that the number of health facilities rose from 9,858 in 2017 to 10,820 in 2018. Oparanya referenced 2018 data, and the latest economic survey bears him out. The numbers come from the Kenya master health facilities list , an inventory of the country's health facilities and community units. These are \"identified with unique code and their details describing the geographical location, administrative location, ownership, type and the services offered\". The list can be sorted to show which facilities are operational and which are closed. As at 18 July 2019 the number of operational health facilities was 11,993. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim \"For the year under review all County Governments allocated out of their budgets at least 20% to health.\" Verdict incorrect The controller of budget's 2017/18 report shows counties allocated KSh109.2 billion to health out of a total budget of KSh411.6 billion. This means 26.5% of the budget went to health. In 2018/19 the counties allocated KSh114.6 billion to health out of a budget of KSh462.1 billion, giving health a 25% share . So the total allocation to health for all the counties was above 20%. But not all counties set aside at least 20% of their budgets for healthcare. In 2017/18 at least five counties allocated less than 20%  to health. These were Kakamega (17.1%), Laikipia (13.4%), Taita Taveta (7.7%), Tana River (17.8%) and Turkana (11.6%). And in 2018/19, nine counties allocated less than 20% of their budgets to health. These were Baringo (2%), Kakamega (13%), Laikipia (13%), Mandera (18%), Nyandarua (11%), Taita Taveta (7%), Tana River (19%), Turkana (11%) and Wajir (17%). We therefore rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim \"Since 2013, County Governments have cumulatively received KSh1.57 trillion worth of equitable share of allocation.\" Verdict mostly-correct Africa Check looked at the controller of budget's reports for 2012/13 , 2013/14 , 2014/15 , 2015/16 , 2016/17 , 2017/18 and the first nine months of  2018/19 . The controller of budget approves the release of revenue from the consolidated fund to the counties. Africa Check previously investigated county figures and found that not all the money allocated to county governments was transferred to them. The controller of budget has cited bureaucratic, legal and technical reasons for this gap. Amounts to Kenya counties 2012/13 to 2018/19 (billions of shillings) Year Total Allocation as per County Allocation of Revenue Acts Treasury transfers to counties as per the national treasury Total amount of approved transfers in reports controller of budget for release to counties 2012/13* 9.8 9.7 9.7 2013/14 210 195.7 174.4 2014/15 242.5 231.1 228.5 2015/16 287.04 276.2 272.1 2016/17 302.2 305 299.7 2017/18 341.7 330.3 328.9 2018/19 372.7 263.4 1 200.9 2 TOTAL 1,765.9 1,611.4 1,514.2 1 Latest figures from the national treasury of disbursements to counties as at  30 May 2019. 2 Latest figures from the report of the controller of budget for the first nine months of 2018/19 as at 31 March 2019 * Transfers in the first quarter under devolution prescribed by the Transition County Appropriation Act, 2013 The State of Devolution Address is dated 28 June 2019. The latest figures show that the treasury transferred KSh1.608 trillion to the counties between March 2013 and 30 May 2019. Up to 31 March 2019, the controller approved KSh1.514 trillion. The amount actually received by counties is between KSh1.611 trillion and KSh1.514 trillion. Oparanya's claim of KSh1.57 trillion is within the ballpark. We therefore rate it as mostly correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim KSh1.57 trillion is equivalent to 20% of the total shareable revenue of 7.8 trillion shillings.\" Verdict correct The total shareable revenue from 2013 to 2019 is given in the division of revenue acts : 2013 \u2013 KSh920.4 billion 2014 \u2013 KSh1,026. 3 billion 2015 \u2013 KSh1,242.7 billion 2016 \u2013 KSh1,380.2 billion 2017 \u2013 KSh1,560.3 billion 2018 \u2013 KSh1,688.5 billion These add up to KSh7, 818 billion, or KSh7.8 trillion \u2013 the exact figure given by Oparanya. According to the treasury, the transfers to county governments as at 30 May 2019 add up to KSh1,611 billion. The controller of budget's report puts the amount approved for use by counties at KSh1,514 trillion up to 31 March 2019. These work out as 21% and 19% of the KSh7.8 trillion in total shareable revenue. Oparanya was right on the money when he said the amount of national revenue transferred to the counties was equivalent to 20% of all the money the counties had received. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim \"The average development allocation by counties over the last six financial years has been 40% surpassing the legal requirement of at least 30%.\" Verdict correct Kenyan law on public finance directs that \"over the medium term a minimum of 30% of the county government's budget shall be allocated to the development expenditure\". The law defines the \"medium term\" as \"a period of not less than three years but not more than five years\". The total allocation over six years, given in the controller of budget's reports , is shown below. The development budget's share was highest in 2014/15, at 44%, and lowest in 2017/18, at 33.9%. County budgets 2013/14 to 2018/19 (billions of shillings) Financial year Recurrent budget Development budget Total budget Development budget share of total budget 2013/14 160.7 100.4 261.1 38.5% 2014/15 181.4 144.9 326.3 44.4% 2015/16 208.8 158.6 367.4 43.2% 2016/17 240.9 158.4 399.3 39.6% 2017/18 271.3 139.2 410.5 33.9% 2018/19 276.4 187.5 463.9 40.4% Total 1,339.5 889 2,228.5 39.9% The average share is 40%. We therefore rate Oparanya's claim as correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Claim So far, each of the 47 counties has met the two-thirds threshold on the appointment of the county executive committee members, with three counties of Kilifi, Nyeri and Kericho attaining a 50-50 representation.\" Verdict correct Kenya's constitution promotes gender equality by setting out that  \"not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender\". The latest economic survey shows that Oparanya was right when he said each of the 47 counties had adhered to this gender principle. It also shows that in Kilifi, Nyeri and Kericho counties there's gender parity in the composition of the county cabinets. The economic survey's data came from the council of governors . Africa Check asked the national gender and equality commission , which oversees the two-thirds gender rule, if there was more recent data. \"We are just about to embark on county audit that will give us a lot of that data,\" commissioner Priscilla Nyokabi told Africa Check. The commission does have the gender data for members of the county assemblies, she said. This is the data used in the 2019 economic survey. \"It will be very important that the gender principle is respected,\"she told us. \"I am asking governors, not just to do the minimum. Wherever they find a woman who performs, give her an opportunity to perform. They should give women an opportunity to serve.\" \u2013 Dancan Bwire Further reading : https://africacheck.org/reports/yes-kenyas-health-budget-has-risen-30-in-last-two-fiscal-years/ https://africacheck.org/reports/how-kenyatta-mangled-his-numbers-on-kenyan-counties-development-spend/ https://africacheck.org/reports/yes-kenyas-county-funding-based-on-five-year-old-national-revenue-figures/",

        "doc": "Both APC office-bearers sought to talk up the APC's economic gains, particularly in Lagos state under former governor Bola Tinubu who is running for president in the February 2023 elections. But they exaggerated the growth of the Lagos economy under Tinubu's governorship and misled about the influence he had on revenue. Lagos state is not the third-largest economy in Africa. Numbers on inflation in the country and abroad were also fudged. Nigeria's election campaign season only officially begins 28 September 2022 , but political parties are already in top gear in the race to win over voters. President Muhammadu Buhari will step down after February 2023 elections, having first been elected on an All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket in 2015. The party has picked Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state and an influential APC member, as its new standard bearer. In two separate media appearances in August 2022, the APC made its case as to why it should be re-elected. First up was Kashim Shettima, who will be the vice president should the party win. Among the claims he made was that Tinubu improved the fortunes of Lagos so much that it was \"now the third largest economy in Africa\". Tinubu was governor from 1999 to 2007 and has remained influential in state politics. A day later, APC campaign spokesperson Festus Keyamo was on TV where he also talked up the records of both the party and Tinubu. Keyamo, who is the junior minister for labour and employment, challenged his host to fact-check him. So we did, by taking a look at eight claims from both appearances. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a commonly used measure of the size of an economy. It is the market value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. Economists have told Africa Check that it is acceptable to compare the GDP of different geographical regions. The most recent data from the World Bank shows Nigeria's GDP was US$440.8 billion in 2021. This is the largest in Africa, a position Nigeria has held since 2013 when it \"rebased\" its GDP to more accurately capture economic activities. Lagos, with an estimated population of more than 15 million, is Nigeria's financial hub . But how big is its economy? The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) publishes quarterly GDP numbers. But they do not include figures for subnational regions like states. For this data, Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at NBS, referred us to the Lagos Bureau of Statistics . In a report on its website, the Lagos bureau gave the state's GDP as N26.6 trillion in 2021, having increased from N23.9 trillion in 2020. Nigeria's official exchange rate often varies . In 2021 it was between N379 and N413.9 to the US dollar. This works out to a GDP of between $64.2 billion and $70.2 billion. At least eight African countries recorded a GDP higher than this in 2021 . We therefore rate this claim as incorrect.  Shettima claimed that in 1999, when Tinubu took office, Lagos earned N700 million monthly as its own revenue, but this had now reached N50 billion. Internally generated revenue is defined as what states earn, independent of the funds they receive from Nigeria's federal government. NBS data on this indicator goes back to 2010, when Lagos generated N185.9 billion, or an average of N15.5 billion monthly. Using referencing clues from a 2014 journal paper that analysed internally generated revenue, we looked up statistical bulletin data from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Links for the 1999 and 2000 bulletins were broken. In 2001 Lagos earned N12.5 billion . This was the same figure as in a journal paper authored by two researchers working with the national assembly's research arm at the time. Their paper also gave internal revenue for Lagos as N11.6 billion in 2000 and N14.6 billion (or an average of N1.2 billion monthly) in 1999. This is at least N460 million a month more than claimed. By starting from a lower base, APC exaggerated the growth in internal revenue. The most recent data on the internal revenue of states published by the statistics bureau covered the first half of 2021. It showed Lagos generated the highest amount, N267.2 billion, or an average of N44.54 billion monthly. In December 2021, Lagos governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu , was quoted by the media saying the state has \"grown its internally generated revenue from N600 million monthly in 1999 to over N45 billion monthly as of today, an astounding increase of 7,400%.\" There is no evidence the state now generates an average revenue of N50 billion monthly. In his interview, Keyamo referred to Tinubu as \"a wealth creator\". Lagos governor Sanwo-Olu has credited Tinubu for starting revenue reforms in the state. But the size of the revenue and the increase in funds is not due to any single administration, Sheriffdeen Tella, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"Lagos has had good administrators as governors over the years but the increase in the state's revenue cannot solely be the result of the effort of any government or administration,\" he said. Tella said the natural location of Lagos near the sea and increased commerce due to the large population were some factors responsible for the increase in revenue. Successive governors had used the increased funds to expand the city, he added. We rate the claim misleading because it creates the impression the state's revenue increased only due to a single person's efforts. To support his point that Buhari's administration had run the economy well, Keyamo said Nigeria's economic woes should be viewed within the global context. He then claimed that the country's inflation rate had increased by only 5% between 2020 and 2022. But he seems to have mixed up a percentage point increase with a percentage increase . Keyamo said inflation moved from about 13% in 2020 to about 18% in 2022. The difference between these is five percentage points, not 5%. ( For more on this, read our guide to avoiding common statistical errors. ) Further, the data shows he compared two different indices. In 2020, the monthly year-on-year inflation rate varied from 12.13% in January to 12.56% in June and 15.75% in December. However, the 12-month average change in December 2020 was 13.25%, which he apparently referred to. For 2022, he referred to an 18.65% year-on-year change in June, while the 12-month average change for that same month was 16.54%. Minister Keyamo said Nigeria fared better than countries like the US, Canada and Spain when it came to managing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. \"Those countries are doing a seven to 10% increase in inflationary rate,\" he said . In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated 2020 annual inflation at 1.2% . In June 2022 it was at 9.1% , a sharp increase that has been widely reported on . The difference between 9.1% and 1.2% is 7.9 percentage points, and not 7.9%. That's not the only problem with this comparison. Tella, the economics professor, said some factors causing inflation were local and others global. \"It is not correct to compare inflation in Nigeria with that of the US and Canada,\" he told Africa Check. This was because those countries had not had the same level of currency devaluation as Nigeria. They also had the capacity to produce more of what they needed. \"But in Nigeria, we are mainly importing. We also import inflation .\" Tella also cited factors such as increasing interest rates and insecurity as local factors causing inflation. Flawed comparison Felix Onah is a professor of economics at Godfrey Okoye University in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria. He told Africa Check it was flawed to compare the average annual inflation rate to the monthly year-on-year inflation rate as they are computed using different methods. \"The basis for comparison is not there. The composition of the items that are taken into account in finding the level of inflation may not exactly be the same in Nigeria and the US for example,\" Onah said in response to our questions. \"The minister is part of the government. He is defending his constituency because no government will want to appear bad.\" A debt crisis is when a country cannot repay its debt. It occurs when revenue earned by the country is lower than its expenditure for a prolonged period. Thirty-nine African countries were included on a World Bank list of countries that were at risk or already in debt distress as of March 2022. 13 countries were classified as being at moderate risk of debt distress 18 were high risk Seven were already in distress Therefore, 25 African countries were at high risk or were already in debt distress. Nigeria was not on the list as Keyamo claimed \u2013 but this was only because the bank considered low-income countries. Nigeria is on the next rung, classified as a lower-middle-income country based on its gross national income (GNI) per capita . These countries have a GNI per capita of between $1,086 and $4,255 . 'GDP does not pay debts' Akpan Ekpo is a macroeconomics professor and a former director of the West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management . He warned that Nigeria's rising debt levels could be harmful. \"To assure Nigerians, the government says the debt to GDP ratio is within sustainable limits but GDP is just about the value of goods and services produced. GDP does not pay debts,\" Ekpo told Africa Check. \"What pays debt is revenue. Take a look at Nigeria's debt to revenue ratio and you will see that it is not sustainable. \"It is not bad to take loans. However, loans must be taken to fund projects that can ultimately repay the loans. Nigeria should not be taking loans to fund recurrent expenditure like salary and pension payments.\" In May, the World Bank approved a $150 million loan to the Lebanese government to import wheat and keep bread prices stable. While Nigeria has not borrowed to fund food imports like Lebanon, the government has received loans and grants to fund agricultural activities and enhance food security. An example is $500 million in World Bank funding to improve livestock production. In July 2022, the African Development Bank approved a $134 million loan for the Nigerian government to boost food production. In August, Nigeria's agriculture minister Mohammed Abubakar listed six projects funded by international organisations to improve agriculture. 'Nigeria cannot be said to have achieved food security' \"The definition of food security implies that a country has sufficient food supply for its citizens and the food must be generally agreed to be quality,\" Jonathan Alimba, a professor of agricultural economics at the Ebonyi State University in Abakaliki, southeastern Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"The food must also be affordable. So food security is hinged on three things: quality, availability and affordability.\" \"Nigeria cannot be said to have achieved food security. There are some instances where some food items are available in the market but citizens cannot afford them.\" There were also Nigerians who could afford food but not of the right quality based on the internationally recognised nutritional requirements for a child or an adult, Alimba said. Insecurity was also partly to blame. \"Farmers in some rural areas do not feel safe enough to go to the farms. If it isn't attacks by bandits and insurgents, it is by herdsmen. The failure to secure lives and property has affected the country's food production. \"To transport food produced from the north to the south is a problem. Food may be available in the north but it is a challenge to bring it down south where it is needed.\"",

        "doc": "The president was right about falling inflation , the number of Kenyans in the informal sector and remittances from the diaspora. However, there wasn't publicly available data to weigh up his claims about Kenya's economic growth, both locally and in comparison to other countries. And the president's claims on imports, unpaid bills, more education funding and a court ruling on a controversial tax didn't stand up to scrutiny. On 17 December 2023 Kenyan president William Ruto hosted journalists at his residence to review his agenda , five days after presiding over events to mark 60 years of independence. Both events received national coverage. Ruto , who took office in September 2022, made several claims about the country's progress since then. We checked these against the publicly available facts. Ruto first made this claim in his independence day speech on 12 December. He then repeated it to the journalists. The country's data agency, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), publishes annual and monthly inflation figures. The most recent data covers November 2023 and shows inflation at 6.8% . The same figure is used by the World Bank in its latest update on Kenya. The data also shows that inflation was higher than 9.2% in 2022 as claimed by the president, having reached 9.59% in October of that year. It appears that Ruto was referring to the start of his term \u2014 inflation was 9.2% in September 2022. He missed an opportunity to show a greater decline. Annual average inflation data as published in the KNBS economic surveys of 2022 and 2023 shows the following trend: Kenya annual average inflation data (2017-2022) Year 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Inflation (%) 8 4.7 5.2 5.4 6.1 7.7 \u2013 Tess Wandia. A country's gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the size of its economy. It is the market value of all the goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. GDP growth is the change in economic output from one year to the next or from one quarter to the next, usually expressed as a percentage. Ruto also repeated this claim to the journalists , having first made it in his national day speech. He cited the World Bank as the source of his data. According to the latest data from the development lender , Kenya's GDP grew by 4.8% in 2022. John Kinuthia , lead research analyst at the International Budget Partnership thinktank in Kenya, also directed us to the bank's latest economic report on the country. This estimated that Kenya's economy grew by 5% in 2023, an \"acceleration\" from the 4.8% recorded in 2022. But these are annual figures. In the first quarter of 2023, citing KNBS data for September 2023 , the bank estimated growth at 5.5%, and 5.4% in the second quarter. Ruto's claim of 5.4% growth in the \"last six months\" only holds true if he was referring to the first half of this year. But there isn't publicly available data for the second half. The World Bank said it acts as a \"knowledge bank\" for global analysis and studies. For the \"specific\" source of the data Ruto cited, spokesperson Keziah Muthembwa referred us back to the presidency. We have contacted State House spokesperson Hussein Mohamed and will update this report with his response. Until then, we can only rate the claim as unproven. (You can read more about what our ratings mean here .) \u2013 Makinia Juma. On both nationally televised occasions , Ruto again cited the World Bank as his source for this claim. The bank's World Development Indicators is a public database covering 217 economies - 189 member countries and 28 \"other\" economies. The database, which is cross-comparable, only records annual GDP growth rates, Kinuthia of the International Budget Partnership told Africa Check Of the 217 countries for which growth rates are available , at least 195 had data up to 2022, the most recent year for which annual data is available. Kenya was ranked 76th with a GDP growth rate of 4.8% in 2022. We have not seen newer data to support Ruto's claim. The World Bank also referred us to the president's office. We've asked Mohamed, his spokesperson, for this information and will update this report when we hear back. Until then, we also rate this claim as unproven. \u2013 Makinia Juma. Ruto told the journalists that his government had \"in fact\" this year \"put an extra KSh120 billion (about US$775 million) in education\". The extra money would be used to hire more teachers, support a new university funding model and improve school infrastructure, the president said earlier in his national day speech , where he gave a different figure of KSh127 billion . For budgetary purposes, Kenya's national treasury considers the education sector to include basic, technical and tertiary education, and the Teachers Service Commission , the country's largest public employer. The office of the controller of budget authorises all government expenditure in keeping with approved budgets. The office publishes quarterly reports showing budget allocation by sector and authorised spending. The most recent, published in November 2023 , showed that the allocation to the education sector increased from KSh544.52 billion in the 2022/23 financial year to KSh628.58 billion in the current 2023/24 financial year - an increase of KSh84.01 billion. Similarly, treasury data released in November 2023 in preparation for the next budget, put funding to the education sector at KSh626.8 billion in 2023/24. This was an increase of KSh83 billion from the KSh543.8 billion budgeted in 2022/23. We have not seen any data showing that the increase in the education budget from the previous year to the current year was KSh120 billion or more. The president's claim is not accurate. \u2013 Tess Wandia. Ruto first made this claim in September 2023. We fact-checked it and found it to be incorrect . But he repeated it in his speech on 12 December, and also to the assembled journalists : \"We are importing KSh500 billion every year [worth] of food items.\" The latest data, published by the country's statistics office in December , shows the claim is still incorrect. The country is estimated to have run up a food and beverage import bill of KSh253.7 billion in 2022, up from KSh212.8 billion in 2021. (The total import bill for 2022 was KSh2.49 trillion or $21.1 billion based on that year's average exchange rate). The food import bill for the first half of 2023 was KSh174.6 billion . Even with a ban on imports of the staple food maize, this figure is unlikely to reach KSh500 billion for the year \u2013 unless the local currency weakens dramatically. \u2013 Dancan Bwire. Ruto said his government would extend retirement benefits coverage to 15 million Kenyans in the informal sector. The informal economy, as defined by the International Labour Organization , includes workers or enterprises that are not adequately covered by official regulations due to inapplicability or non-compliance. In Kenya, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, the informal sector typically includes activities such as petty trading, selling second-hand goods, shoe shining, street vending, carpentry and repair and construction work. The Kenya National Bureau of Standards publishes annual economic surveys containing employment data. The most recent highlights the informal sector as the main source of employment for the working population in Kenya, covering an estimated 15.96 million out of 19.1 million workers. The claim checks out. \u2013 Tess Wandia. Ruto claimed that the country's imports had fallen due to the weakening shilling \"because our exports are now much more attractive\" and the local currency was now at market rates. Kenya's statistics bureau keeps monthly data on imports and exports. The data shows that in September 2022, when Ruto took office, the import bill was KSh207.6 billion. It has since ranged from a low of KSh175.3 billion in February to a high of KSh238.8 billion in August. In September 2023, the most recent data, the value of imports was KSh215.6 billion - higher than when Ruto started his term. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu. The president said he wanted to increase the amount of foreign currency coming into Kenya from $4 billion to $10 billion. This has been a notable talking point during his visits abroad. The Central Bank of Kenya publishes monthly data on foreign remittances. The data shows that in 2022, Kenya received $4.03 billion in remittances from abroad. In the first ten months of 2023, the diaspora has so far remitted $3.5 billion. Ruto's baseline of $4 billion dollars in diaspora remittances is on the money. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu. The World Bank classifies Kenya, Morocco and Tunisia as lower-middle-income countries , with a gross national income of between $1,036 and $4,045 per capita. Gross national income (GNI) is a measure of a country's total economic output and income. It includes the total value of its GDP plus the net income it receives from other countries, such as remittances and dividends from overseas investments. Kenya is in the same lower-middle-income band as Morocco and Tunisia, but not with South Africa, which is classified as an upper-middle-income country.  These are countries with average GNI per capita incomes between $4,046 and $12,535. So while both Kenya and South Africa are middle-income countries , with a GNI per capita of $6,780 in 2022, the latest year available, the latter's was more than three times that of Kenya. But Ruto's broader point is correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu. Defending his government's controversial taxes , Ruto claimed that Kenyans were not overtaxed. \"You know the people of Kenya are being pushed and being told, look you're are paying more taxes than other countries. Is that true, that is not true, we are paying tax like all countries that are in our same category,\" he said . He mentioned South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia by way of comparison. Taxes as a percentage of GDP show the amount of economic output that ends up as government revenue. It gives an indication of how efficient governments are at collecting taxes and how much people and companies are taxed. According to the World Bank, countries should raise revenues equivalent to at least 15% of GDP to meet the basic needs of citizens and businesses. The latest data on this is published in the Organisation for Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Revenue Statistics in Africa 2023 . This shows that in 2021 Kenya's taxes amounted to 15.2% of GDP, Morocco's 27.1% (and not 32%, which is Tunisia's ratio) and South Africa's 27%. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu. Ruto has defended raising taxes to pay off Kenya's crippling debt . Asked about the large share of government taxes that drive up fuel prices in the country, Ruto said he needed the taxes to keep his government afloat. But does 70% of Kenya's revenue go to paying taxes, leaving only 30% for other government operations? We previously fact-checked a similar claim where he put debt service as a proportion of revenue at 60%. We found that 58.7% of tax revenue goes to debt service. In the 2023/24 financial year, the government hopes to collect KSh2.495 trillion in tax revenue, according to the latest report from the controller of budget, with data up to 30 September 2023. Of this, KSh1.75 trillion is expected to be used to service the public debt. This works out to 70.1%. In the first three months of the 2023/24 financial year, the government collected KSh514.3 billion in tax revenue and spent KSh347.2 billion - 67.5% - on debt repayment. We therefore rate the president's claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu. At the roundtable with journalists, the Kenyan president claimed that the government owed suppliers and contractors a total of KSh506 billion ($3.3 billion). In its quarterly update published in November 2023, the national treasury recorded that the state owes KSh630.6 billion in outstanding bills as at September 2023. The office of the controller of budget has data on pending bills for both national and county governments. As at 30 September, the office reported the value of outstanding bills at KSh794.18 billion . National government ministries and departments owe KSh121.2 billion , government corporations KSh509.4 billion and counties KSh163.6 billion . The president's figure is much lower. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu. The controversial housing levy is designed to raise money for affordable housing. The Finance Act 2023 directed employers to deduct 1.5% of each employee's gross salary, with each employer having to contribute the same amount per employee. On 28 November 2023, the high court ruled that the levy was unconstitutional, but stayed the ruling to allow the government to appeal. When Ruto spoke to journalists on 17 December, he implied that they had misreported the court's decision. \"The problem of unconstitutional was made by the media,\" he claimed . When the journalists corrected him , he stuck to his guns. \"If it is unconstitutional, why did the courts say we should continue to collect?\" Ruto asked . In their reporting of this exchange, the media seemed to backtrack . So we listened to the court ruling and tracked down the judgement to find out exactly what the courts said about the housing levy. The three-judge bench of the Kenyan high court did say the law was unconstitutional, but stayed the ruling until 10 January 2023 to allow the government to appeal. Ruto's claim is incorrect. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Many Nigerians would love to get N50,000 for free from their bank. But these Facebook posts claiming to have a code for it may be out to scam you. A Facebook post claims that there is a secret code for Nigerians to get N50,000 (about US$63) from some banks. The banks listed are: Access Bank, Wema Bank, UBA, GTBank, First Bank, FCMB, Keystone, Fidelity, OPay, PalmPay and Kuda. The 2 December 2023 post reads , in part: \"INTERESTED PERSON SHOULD SIGNIFY BY HOW DO I DO IT Or text How do I do it.\" But there is no explanation of what kind of \"code\" this might be. The post, published on a public group with over 21,000 members, includes a WhatsApp link and a photo of the popular TV presenter Morayo Afolabi-Brown . She hosts a show called Your View on the TVC channel. Similar posts can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Some of the posts were published on Facebook groups with over 247,000 members. But is this \"secret code\" legit? We checked. From 'code' to 'investment platform' We initiated a conversation on WhatsApp to find out more about the \"code\" and the promised N50,000. The account replied, saying : \"You are welcome to Boldgain international investment platform.\" Africa Check previously investigated a platform known as Bold Gains investment and exposed it as a scam. The slight difference in the names \u2013 \"Boldgain international investment\" and \"Bold Gains investment\" \u2013 led us to believe that we were once again dealing with a scam. We were then told that there were three packages available, with each promising to double our investment. In a bid to convince us that the platform was legit, the account sent us several videos of people claiming to have benefited from it. But this is a tactic often used by scammers to lure unsuspecting users. We were also asked for our personal details. This is a red flag, as this information can be used to commit fraud. To end things off, the account provided us with bank details for us to make the initial investment. There was no mention of a \"code\" or the N50,000 from the banks as mentioned on the Facebook posts, a sign that the person we were talking to could not be trusted. Banks react Africa Check reached out to PalmPay on X (formerly Twitter) to verify the claim that there was a code that could get customers N50,000. \"We have put up disclaimers on our official verified pages in a bid to sensitise customers to these pages and fictitious links,\" the company's rep said. OPay also responded to our enquiry, saying: \"OPay will not redirect you to links or request for your OTP, password and PIN.\" The OPay rep then urged users to \"be vigilant to avoid being scammed\".

        "doc": "The publications were correct on one count \u2013 that 60% of people in Africa are younger than 25. The weakening of the shilling under president William Ruto was understated \u2013 it's higher \u2013 and claims about the growth of the country's public debt and debt-to-GDP ratio were outright incorrect. The media also got Kenya's population figures wrong, as the country had a projected population of 51.5 million in 2023, not 40 million, with 35% \u2013 not 45% \u2013 younger than 15. Kenya's debt burden remains an issue of national debate , as picked up by the artificial intelligence (AI) tool Africa Check uses to monitor public debate. On 17 January 2024 the International Monetary Fund approved the release of US$941.2 million to Kenya, as the country's treasury burns the midnight oil to get public debt under control. The IMF has even set up a page of \" frequently asked questions \" about its loans to Kenya. A rapidly depreciating currency has added to the economic woes, creating a political headache for president William Ruto , who took office in September 2022. There is also pressure on the government to improve the livelihoods of young Kenyans, sparking debate about the size of the population. As Ruto's government urges patience , we identified eight claims related to the Kenyan economy and checked them for accuracy. On 16 January 2024, Kenya's Star newspaper published an article on the country's debt burden, claiming that in the decade between 2013 and 2023 \"the total public debt grew almost five times to $69 billion (KSh11.1 trillion)\". Africa Check contacted the author, who shared a presentation by Stears, a Nigerian data and business intelligence company, which was publicly released on 4 January . The Stears report noted that \" between 2013 and 2023, the total public debt grew 5x [five times] to $69 billion \u2026\". The report says the final figure was converted using the average 2013 exchange rate of \"KSh139.8 to the dollar\". However, the company did not provide any information on the source of the underlying data. Analysts have previously told Africa Check that Kenya's national treasury publishes annual debt data according to the financial year, which runs from 1 July to 30 June. The country's central bank further publishes monthly debt data. This showed that public debt stood at KSh1.79 trillion in December 2012 and KSh1.81 trillion in January 2013. The most recent monthly report put the total public debt at KSh10.6 trillion, as at 30 September 2023. This was also the figure recorded by the treasury in its most recent quarterly economic report, published in November 2023. The increase from KSh1.79 trillion at the end of 2012 (and KSh1.8 trillion at the beginning of 2013) to KSh10.6 trillion at the end of September 2023, the latest month for which the Star has compiled data, is 5.9 times. The debt did increase more than fivefold in Kenyan shilling terms. But in dollar terms, which the claim has considered, the increase is 3.5 times. Further, as of September 2023, external debt accounted for 53.5% of Kenya's gross public debt. But there's little doubt that debt has increased. On 17 January 2024, the IMF published a report estimating Kenya's debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio at 67.9% in 2022, with projections of 73.2% in 2023 and 73.3% in 2024. \u2013 Makinia Juma Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the size of a country's economy and refers to the market value of all goods and services produced during a given period, usually a year. The debt-to-GDP ratio measures the level of debt relative to the size of the economy, Noah Wamalwa of the Institute of Economic Affairs - Kenya , a public policy thinktank, told Africa Check. If the ratio is low, it means that the amount of debt is relatively small compared to the size of the economy, and therefore the country is able to repay the debt without much difficulty, he said. Kenya's treasury publishes annual debt management reports with debt-to-GDP data. In June 2012, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 40.7%, and 42.1% in June 2013, according to the 2015/16 debt report. It increased to 68.1% in June 2021 and was provisionally estimated at 67.3% in June 2022. The most recent monthly debt data showed the debt ratio at 70.8% of GDP in June 2023. In a January 2024 report , the IMF projected the ratio at 73.2% in 2023. \u2013 Makinia Juma We found this claim in a story published by Kenyan digital news platform Tuko . \"The shilling has lost over 27% of its value since president William Ruto took over power,\" read the caption to a photo of the Kenyan leader. Ruto was sworn in on 13 September 2022. According to central bank data , the shilling traded at KSh120.37 on 14 September 2022, a day after his inauguration. On 16 January 2024, when the Tuko article was published, the Kenyan currency was at KSh160.18 to the dollar. The difference is KSh39.81 or 33.1%, significantly higher than in the claim. We therefore rate it as understated. (Note: See what our ratings mean.) \u2013 Dancan Bwire. The Kenyan shilling has been steadily losing value. What does this mean? Noah Wamalwa of the Institute of Economic Affairs Kenya , a public policy thinktank in Nairobi, said the depreciation meant that \"you are using more shillings to buy a dollar than you were a year ago\". Is that good or bad? \"It depends on the context,\" Wamalwa told Africa Check. \"It is usually a good thing if the country is in a position to benefit from the weak shilling in terms of increased exports. But when a country is also in a situation where it has to meet its debt obligations, which are huge, especially on the external side, such as at this time, it is not a good thing,\" he said. The Kenyan national treasury said that as of June 2023, just over two-thirds ( 67.2% ) of Kenya's external debt was in US dollars, while another 21.3% was in euros. At that time, external debt accounted for 52.9% of total debt. In September 2023, the most recent data available, external debt accounted for 53.5% of the total. The country has been under pressure to pay its foreign loans. International rating agencies Fitch and Moodys have downgraded Kenya, citing risks associated with the weakening shilling. Economic predictions show that Kenya is \"likely to face a debt repayment crunch in 2024\" as foreign debt matures . Dr Joseph Muniu, the chair of the department of applied economics at Nairobi's Kenyatta University , said Kenyans would now be forced to dig deeper into their pockets to import as the purchasing power of the shilling had fallen. Exporters were benefiting, he told Africa Check. \"If you used to export something and you were being paid one dollar, in the past it could attract KSh120. Right now it will fetch you KSh160,\" he told Africa Check. Muniu said that when a country imports more than it exports, it loses money. The latest data released on 29 December 2023 shows that Kenya's imports totalled KSh648.6 billion and exports KSh269.4 billion in the third quarter (July-September) of the year. \"In the short run, the country suffers, but in the long run, more exporters will come on board because of the good returns, which is a good thing.\" This claim comes from a guest blog on Nation.Africa , the website of Kenya's largest media house . The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics publishes annual population estimates from a census conducted every ten years. The last census took place in 2019 and put Kenya's population at 47.6 million . The latest population estimates, published in the bureau's flagship annual economic survey for 2023, show that Kenya had a projected population of 51.5 million in 2023. Kenya's population was 40 million in 2012, more than a decade ago. The claim is incorrect. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The Nation.Africa blog also claimed that 45% of Kenya's population was under the age of 15. The author cited the national statistics bureau as the source. The bureau's 2019 census report showed that 18.5 million people were under the age of 15. This was 38.98% of the population at the time. In the latest estimates published in November 2022, the under-15 population was expected to fall to 18.37 million or 35.7% of the total population of 51.5 million in 2023. In 2024, with a projected total population of 52.4 million, the under-15 population is expected to be 18.45 million or 35.2% of the total population. We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The 2019 census report and the 2023 analytical report on population dynamics showed that 9.7 million out of 47.6 million people, or 20.4% of the population, were aged between 15 and 24. The most recent estimates , published in November 2022, projected the population aged 15 to 24 to be 10.8 million out of 51.5 million, or 20.9% of the total population in 2023. In 2024, this age group is projected to reach 10.9 million, or 20.8% of a total population of 52.4 million. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The Nation.Africa blog also claimed that 60% of Africa's population is under the age of 25. Data on this can be found in the World Population Prospects 2022 , as United Nations population official Dr Thomas Spoorenberg has previously told Africa Check. The most recent data covers the year 2021. It showed that out of 1.39 billion people in Africa, 829.4 million are under the age of 25. This is 59.7%. ( Editor's note: A downloadable Excel file is available here . ) We also checked this claim when the US ambassador to Kenya Margaret \"Meg\" Whitman made it in 2023 and found it to be accurate. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi The AI tool matched this claim to an earlier one made by president Ruto three times , including on New Year's Eve 2023 . In verifying Ruto's claim, we asked the World Bank for data, but the bank referred us back to his office. We rated the claim as unproven pending a response. According to his bio, the author of the Nation.Africa article works for the \"Presidential Communication Service\". We have contacted him for the source and will update this report when we hear back. Of the 217 countries for which World Bank growth rates are available , at least 195 had data up to 2022, the most recent year for which annual data is available. Kenya was ranked 75th, with a GDP growth rate of 4.8% in 2022. The latest data from the International Monetary Fund includes estimates of GDP growth data for 195 countries. The data also puts Kenya's growth rate for 2022 at 4.8%. This placed the country 81st, tied with Albania, Austria, Bhutan and Liberia. The growth rate for 2023 is estimated at 5%, placing Kenya 34th, alongside China, Indonesia and Djibouti. ( Editor's note: A downloadable Excel file is available here . ) When countries with similar growth rates are ranked together, Kenya placed 44th in 2022 and 21st in 2023. ( See our working here ). However, it is important to note that the 2023 numbers are projections. The 29th place claim therefore remains unproven, as we have yet to see the World Bank data cited by the Kenyan presidency. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi",

        "doc": "South Africa will celebrate its national Youth Day next week. The country's government has just approved a new National Youth Policy that will be implemented until 2020. The policy (with the tag line \"We don't want a hand-out, we want a hand up!\") outlines the problems facing South African youth and suggests policy interventions. Africa Check investigated some of the key claims made in the policy document about crime and health in South Africa. Victimisation and offending Claim \"Research by the Institute for Security Studies (2003) indicates that the 12 to 21 age group has the largest number of offenders and victims compared to other age groups in South Africa.\" Verdict unproven A group of men stand with their hands against the wall after the house where they were gambling was raided, in Manenburg in 2013. Photo: AFP/Rodger Bosch\" /> The claim that young people, aged between 12 and 21, are most likely both to offend and become to victims of crime is referenced indirectly in the September 2003 issue of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS)'s SA Crime Quarterly journal, in a piece written by Patrick Burton of the Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention (CJCP). It is important to note that the piece is an analysis of crime trends in Meadowlands, a suburb of Soweto, not the country as a whole. The same claim also appears in three other reports from 2005 onwards (see here , here and here ). None cite research conducted in South Africa. The sources include a 1998 Israeli National Youth Survey and a 1998 report by researchers from the University of Maryland . The research director at CJCP, Lezanne Leoschut, told Africa Check that at the time of the ISS article, South Africa had no data on youth victimisation at all. Lizette Lancaster, project manager of the Crime and Justice Information and Analysis Hub at the ISS, told Africa Check that there was limited funding to conduct national victimisation surveys in South Africa. As a result, researchers sometimes rely on studies from other countries. \"Most of Africa is 'silent' on victimisation, other than some UN-commissioned studies being done in Kenya and Tanzania,\" she added. The findings from these studies cannot be applied to South Africa. A national study carried out by the CJCP provides some insight into youth victimisation. Its 2008 study , which surveyed 4,391 young people between 12 and 22, found that 27% of them had been victims of crime in the previous 12 months. By contrast, a 2007 ISS study of adult victimisation rates found that 20.3% of respondents had been victimised in the last 12 months. However, this study's sample included people aged 16 and older. This overlaps with the youth sample and hampers comparisons. Neither study provided an overall offending rate. At present, available data from victimisation surveys cannot tell us which age group is more likely to be offenders or victims of crime. The best source of information on  youth offending is incarceration data from SAPS, Leoschut said. Traffic deaths Claim \"In 2013, of the total 5,698 deaths in South Africa due to transport, 2,515 were among youth, indicating that 44% of all traffic accident deaths in the country occurred among the youth.\" Verdict unproven Rescue workers remove a bus that plummeted off a bridge in Meyerton, south of Johannesburg, killing nineteen people in June 2012. Photo: AFP\" /> The 2013 SA report on Mortality and Causes of Death by Statistics SA recorded a total of 5,698 deaths due to transport accidents in all age groups that year, with 2,515, or about 45% of those coming in the 15 to 34 age group. The first number is exactly the same as given by the Youth Policy document, and the other numbers are the same. At first glance, it would appear, therefore, that the claim is correct. However, experts in road safety make clear that these statistics often underestimate the number of deaths. A specialist scientist at the Medical Research Council 's Burden of Disease Research Unit, Richard Matzopolous, told Africa Check that deaths are often incorrectly categorised by the Department of Home Affairs and this influences the estimates. \"Even though reporting of total injury deaths is fairly complete, the [death certificates] have poor coding of injury deaths, that is, a poor distinction between road accidents, other unintentional causes, homicide, etcetera,\" Matzopolous said. Deaths due to assault and suicide Claim \"Of the total number of deaths due to assault and intentional self-harm in the country, 69% and 59% of them, respectively, occurred among those aged 15-34 years.\" Verdict correct South African paramedics carry a knife wounded man to be treated at a police station in 2006. Photo: Gianluigi Guercia/AFP\" /> Deaths caused by assault and by intentional self-harm, or suicide, are part of a larger category called 'non-natural' deaths that also includes deaths other causes such as traffic accidents. According to the Stats SA Causes of Death 2013 report, there were a total of 46,527 non-natural deaths in the country the year before last. As the age groups used in the report are not the same as in the claim, we spoke to Vusi Nzimakwe, Stats SA's principal statistician for births and deaths. His figures for 2013 showed a total of 5,019 deaths due to assault and 592 due to intentional self-harm, across all age groups. For ages 15 to 34, there were 3,474 deaths due to assault and 348 for suicide. In other words in 2013, 69% of all deaths due to assault and 59% of all deaths due to suicide were of people aged between 15 and 34. Teenage pregnancy Claim \"The prevalence of pregnancy increased with age, rising from 0.7% for females aged 14 years, to 12.1% for females aged 19 years.\" Verdict correct The claim is taken directly from Statistics South Africa's most recent General Household Survey report and reflects a broadly steady picture over recent years, as the figures from the past five surveys show. Age 14 (%) Age 19 (%) 2009 0.7 11 2010 1.6 12.5 2011 0.4 11.5 2012 0.4 10.2 2013 0.7 12.1 Source: General Household Surveys The people polled were asked whether female members of their household between the ages of 12 and 50 years were pregnant in the year before the survey. The problem with such figures is that they don't tell us how many teenagers became mothers, and people often think they do, Samantha Willan, a research associate at the Health Economics and HIV/Aids Research Division, at the University of Kwazulu-Natal, told Africa Check. \"This [data] does not translate to live births and teenage mothers, but rather the number of girls who became pregnant, some of whom may have miscarried, aborted or had stillbirths,\" Willan explained. Claim \"4.5% of teenage girls between the ages 13-19 were reported pregnant in 2013.\" Verdict mostly-correct The 2013 General Household Survey (GHS) recorded that 5.4% of girls between 13 and 19 had been pregnant in the previous year. This figure is slightly higher than the figure quoted in the policy document, but the rate has been falling for years and experts think the real figure close enough to call it broadly accurate. Research by the Southern African Labour-Development Research Unit (SALDRU) has shown a gradual and significant decline in teen fertility rates since 1984. Katharine Hall, senior researcher at the Children's Institute at the University of Cape Town, told Africa Check she thought the claim was broadly correct. In her analysis of the 2013 survey's data, she used slightly different age groups and found that 4.2% of females aged 15-17 were reported to have been pregnant and 12.3% of those aged 18-20 had been pregnant. \"The results are also broadly consistent with more detailed analysis of teenage fertility rates (i.e. live births), conducted by SALDRU and based on data over a 15-year period,\" she said. It is more useful to reflect on the overall trend of teenage pregnancy rather than one year's statistics, she added.

They use the name of Crowd One, a well-known investment scam. The Facebook pages Crowd One , Crowd one , Crowd one investment LTD , Crowd one company , Crowd one global investment and Crowd one appear to offer investment opportunities to NIgerians. The pages have one thing in common: they use the name of Crowd One, also spelt Crowd 1, a well-known investment scam . One of the posts on the Crowd One page, dated 13 October 2023, reads: \"CROWD 1 INVESTMENT is a multi-level  MKT company that is Paying constantly. It was just newly launched in Nigeria With mama Gee for General  live at CROWD 1.\" The post invites users to send a direct message to the page or follow the attached WhatsApp link. It also features videos of testimonials from people who claim to have benefited from the investment platform. Similar posts from the pages can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the pages and the investment platform they advertise legit? We checked. Suspicious Facebook pages According to their page transparency sections, the Facebook pages were created in 2022 and 2023 . Considering that these Facebook pages are supposed to represent a business serving millions of customers, it seems odd that they have few followers and little activity on their timelines. Their posts are also poorly written, a sign that they're not run by a professional company. Three of the pages don't have an email address, while the other three use Gmail accounts. None of them link to a website. Credible companies usually have functioning websites and professional email addresses. Crowd One, a Ponzi scheme On 2 November 2020 , the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) investigated Crowd One, alleging that the platform was targeting Africans. The BBC investigation revealed that the platform was a Ponzi scheme set up by the Swedish Jonas Eric Werner. A Ponzi scheme is a type of an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. Dubawa, a fact-checking organisation based in Nigeria, have also investigated the resurgence of the Crowd One platform and concluded that it is not to be trusted . Victims of Crowd One Many victims of Crowd One have come forward since 2020. Nigeria's financial crime commission has also warned the public against investing in suspicious platforms. The warning reads , in part: \"Nigerians are by this notice, warned to be wary of fraudulent schemes and are hereby enjoined to resist the temptation of quick gain that could end in misery.\" Unfortunately, some users have fallen for investment scams, so fact-checking helps prevent more people from falling victim.

        "doc": "President Cyril Ramaphosa was most on the money when it came to claims about education, access to basic services and health markers in South Africa. Literacy rates have improved significantly since 1994, more than 85% of households access water and electricity, the government's antiretroviral treatment programme is impressive and the incidence of tuberculosis is decreasing. However, the ANC understated the number of South Africans employed in 1994, inflating the growth in employment over 30 years, and was unclear on the number of free \"houses\" provided and how many of these were women-owned. The city of Mbombela in South Africa's Mpumalanga province was the location for this year's African National Congress (ANC) January 8th statement . The annual event marks the anniversary of the country's ruling party, which turned 112 in 2024. \"We are here to celebrate our past, to chart the future and outline the tasks for the period ahead,\" president Cyril Ramaphosa told the crowds gathered at Mbombela Stadium. Mindful of \"complex moments\" both at home and globally, Ramaphosa spoke of the significant improvements that had taken place in South Africa over the last 30 years, made possible by his party. \"There are those who say nothing has changed, but they also know that they are not telling the truth.\" To support his argument, Ramaphosa made several claims, which we've fact-checked in this report. Women should be represented in all public institutions, Ramaphosa said , before claiming that almost half of the seats in parliament were held by women. This is true for the n ational a ssembly . According to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), an organisation that represents several international parliaments, 45.8% of the 400 seats in South Africa's parliament are held by women. One of the ANC's greatest achievements, Ramaphosa said , was the expansion of basic services and infrastructure. Using housing as an example, Ramaphosa said: \"I know of no country \u2013 certainly on our continent, and in other continents as well \u2013 that has built houses, 4.7 million, and given them to our people mahala.\" \"Mahala\" is Southern Sesotho for \"free\". Listeners would be forgiven for thinking that \"4.7 million houses\" meant physical buildings. With this claim, Ramaphosa appears to have deviated from the version of his speech published on the ANC website , which said that \"through the provision of houses, subsidies and serviced sites, government has managed to provide 4.7 million homes\". But we can only fact-check what he said, and not what he intended to say. It is correct that the Department of Human Settlements (DHS) has provided about 4.8 million \"housing opportunities\" since 1994. But a \"housing opportunity\" is not the same as a \"house\". \"Housing opportunities\" include several categories of government housing which range from newly constructed housing to bare plots of land which have only been connected to utilities, such as water, electricity, and sewage. In 2019 , the DHS provided Africa Check with a complete breakdown of the number of housing opportunities it had delivered up to December 2018. Manually adding the numbers of newly built houses listed in each of the department's annual reports published since then, we counted a total of 3,459,965 newly built houses .  We therefore rate this claim as misleading. At Africa Check we apply this rating when elements of the claim are accurate but presented in a way that it is misleading. F\u00e9b\u00e9 Potgieter, head of policy and research at the ANC, told Africa Check that the source of this data was the DHS, which \"keeps a database of all beneficiaries of government housing subsidies, broken down by gender\". She provided a photograph of a portion of a spreadsheet, which lists female \"total approved beneficiaries\" by province. The figures add up to 1,917,851. It is not clear from the photograph exactly what categories of state-provided housing are included in this count. But Potgieter said that the DHS database \"includes breaking new ground housing subsidies (RDP) and FLISP subsidies\". Breaking new ground houses, formerly known as reconstruction and development programme (RDP) houses, are newly built houses. The \"First Home Finance\" programme, previously known as the \"Finance Linked Individual Subsidy Programme\" (FLISP), assists recipients with loans for buying houses, apartments and serviced sites, or for building homes on already purchased sites. Potgieter also pointed Africa Check to an article on state-subsidised housing which used data collected by Lightstone Property , a data and analytics firm. Lightstone data indicated that 1.05 million women were single owners of breaking new ground housing, and 600,000 more were joint owners with another person. This means 1.65 million women were the owners of newly built houses. Presumably, the remainder is made up of women who received housing subsidies, but this is difficult to verify from the photo we were sent. We have reached out to Lightstone Property and the DHS for clarity. Until then, we rate the claim unproven. In other words, publicly available information neither proves nor disproves this claim. Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), the country's data agency, tracks households' access to basic services every two years in its general household survey (GHS). The latest survey covers 2022 and supports Ramaphosa's claim. Just under 89% of households reported having access to piped water, including inside their dwelling or yard, or outside the yard, for example from neighbours' or communal taps. When looking only at piped water access inside a household's dwelling or yard, this number drops to 75.8% in the GHS. The 2022 national census also contains estimates for water access. It reported that 91.3% of households had access to piped water (of any type), and 82.4% to piped water inside the dwelling or yard. Africa Check spoke with Ni\u00ebl Roux, Stats SA's director of service delivery statistics, about the differences in the census and GHS figures. He said that while the GHS is vital to tracking trends over time, \"census figures should generally be considered more accurate\" because of their larger sample size. Where the GHS surveyed tens of thousands of households, the census surveyed millions. But there were also other possible reasons for the different figures, Roux said. For instance, there were slight differences in how the questions were formatted in the GHS and the census. And while the census collected data from February 2022, the GHS was from July of that year. But, Roux said, the impact of this date difference would be very small. Whatever estimates are used, the quality of water in the country's supply systems is an issue. According to a recent assessment by the water department, almost half (46%) of South Africa's water supply systems \"achieved poor or bad quality\" compliance with standards set out for safe, clean drinking water. In comparison, in 2014 only 5% of systems were given this status. The Department of Water and Sanitation said this indicated \"a severe regression in drinking water quality between 2014 and 2023\". The 2022 GHS reported that 89.6% of households surveyed had access to mains electricity, referring to electricity provided by a municipality or Eskom, the state-owned energy company. In 2002, when the first GHS survey was conducted, the figure stood at 76.7%. Ramaphosa missed an opportunity to claim a higher figure. It is worth mentioning that while access to electricity has improved, planned electricity outages, or load shedding, affected supply on 335 days in 2023 and 15 days in 2024 at time of publication. While exact numbers vary, experts agree that load shedding severely impacts the South African economy. In addition to housing, the ANC-led government had dramatically improved access to education, Ramaphosa said , from early childhood right through to post-school education: \"Nearly every young person aged 15 to 24 years is literate.\" Stats SA bases an individual's functional literacy on whether they have completed at least grade 7. According to a factsheet published by the higher education department in March 2022, and using 2020 data from Stats SA, the percentage of people aged between 15 and 24 who had not completed grade 7 was 7.1% . Ramaphosa's claim is therefore correct. According to Stats SA, improved access to schooling has led to a significant decline in the percentage of functionally illiterate individuals in the 20 to 39 age group. In 2002, this figure stood at 32.9%. In 2022, it was 7.1%. Measuring literacy in line with international standards A simple definition of literacy is the ability to read and write in at least one language. But the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) defines literacy as \"the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials\". This type of literacy is typically measured using the developmental outcomes expected from certain grades in school. Internationally, students in grade 4 are expected to be able to read for meaning. That is, they should be able to read, process, contextualise, and understand the message of a text. South African students tend to underperform in international benchmark tests, such as the Progress in Reading Literacy Study , when examined in grade 4. The Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) cites this as one of the reasons why it uses grade 7 as its measure of literacy. Keeping with the theme of education, Ramaphosa next spoke about adult literacy. Over the years, government interventions such as adult basic education training (ABET) and the Kha Ri Gude literacy campaign have been introduced to improve adult literacy levels. The DHET defines adults as people aged 20 and older. Adults are considered functionally literate if they have completed grade 7 (or the equivalent ABET level 3). According to Stats SA's latest GHS, adult literacy stood at 89% in 2022. Ramaphosa missed the opportunity to claim a larger percentage. Stats SA's 1996 general census had data on the number of adults who had completed primary school. The figure was 63.9% , making Ramaphosa's claim correct. Antiretroviral therapy , or ART, is a treatment programme for the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV . While there is currently no cure for HIV, ART can reduce the level of the virus in a person's blood to a point where it becomes undetectable, untransmittable, and does not progress to the deadly acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or Aids. Former South African president Thabo Mbeki controversially delayed the provision of ART in South Africa, significantly worsening the country's HIV/Aids epidemic . However, since the widespread rollout of ART began in 2004, Aids-related deaths have fallen dramatically , and South Africa now has an expansive and effective HIV treatment programme, which provides care to millions of people. But how many exactly? The health department said in its 2022/23 annual report that there were 5,453,928 patients \"on antiretroviral therapy remaining in care\" under its district health programme grant. This grant funds the government's ART programme, but it does not include some ART patients, such as those who receive ART through the private sector. The health department does not report the total number of ART patients, but fortunately, very accurate estimates do exist. The Thembisa model is a robust estimate of HIV-related figures. The Joint UN Programme on HIV and Aids has used it as their official source for South Africa since 2017. It estimated that between 5.8 and 5.9 million people were receiving ART in 2023. In comparison, the model estimates that there are around 7.9 million people with HIV in South Africa. The model is very reliable . It is regularly adjusted to match newly released data, including from the private sector, to ensure that it is accurately representative of all ART patients. Tuberculosis , or TB, is a bacterial disease which kills millions of people worldwide each year. It was the second leading cause of death in 2022, after Covid-19. TB affects the lungs and is of particular concern in South Africa because it is especially dangerous to people with HIV and other diseases that weaken the immune system. According to data collected by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases , the incidence of TB \u2013 that is, the proportion of the population with the disease \u2013 fell from 738 confirmed cases per 100,000 people in 2011, to 92 in 2022. The only year in which this incidence rose, was 2021, when it peaked above the 2020 figure. Unconfirmed case numbers may be much higher. South Africa's first National TB Prevalence Survey estimated an incidence of around 852 cases per 100,000 people in 2018. But the trend is still encouraging. Data from the World Health Organization indicates that South Africa's TB incidence is not only falling but that it is one of only six others among 30 \"high TB burden countries\" to meet the 2020 goal of the organisation's End TB Strategy . According to findings from the October Household Survey (OHS), Stats SA estimated that a total of 8.9 million people were employed in 1994. The OHS was conducted annually until 1999 when it was replaced by the Labour Force Survey . Though the 1994 OHS comprised too few black respondents to be fully representative, it was considered a \"benchmark \u2026 in information gathering\", surveying 30,000 households and for the first time including the nominally independent black \"homelands\" or Bantustans in country statistics. By claiming a lower figure, Ramaphosa has exaggerated the progress made since 1994. The latest data, available in Stats SA's Quarterly Labour Force Survey, showed that between July and September 2023, 16.745 million people were employed. But comparing this with historical figures is not straightforward. Africa Check spoke with Dr Neva Makgetla , senior economist at the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies research institute, who said that looking only at these raw numbers was problematic. While the raw number of employed people has increased, so has the working-age population (ages 15 to 64), from 24.6 million in 1994 to 40.9 million today. A more accurate way to look at the situation, Makgetla said, was as a ratio of those employed compared to the working-age population. The ratio stood at 41% in 2024, which was approximately the same as in 1994, Makgetla told us. Moreover, the expanded unemployment rate, including discouraged work-seekers or others who did not seek work, was reported as 35% in 1994, and it was higher in 2024, at 41.2% . And this isn't the only problem. According to Makgetla, the earlier employment data was generally less reliable. As some researchers note , the different methods and kinds of data used in calculations for the October Household Survey and subsequent labour force surveys mean the results of these studies may not even be comparable to each other. We therefore rate this claim misleading. The growth of a country's economy is often measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), the sum of all the goods and services produced in the country in a given year. As the World Bank explains , GDP is reported in current (nominal) and constant (real) prices. Constant GDP accounts for the effects of inflation, and so can measure \"real\" economic growth. South Africa's real GDP was US$360.7 billion in 2022, according to the World Bank. In 1994, real GDP stood at $187.4 billion . Overall, real GDP has seen an upward trend, with mostly steady increases over the last 30 years, except for dips during the global recession in 2008 and at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  Prof Jannie Rossouw from the Wits Business School at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg told Africa Check that other indicators painted a less rosy picture. Per capita GDP, for instance, had not fared as well, Rossouw said. This measures a country's economic output per person. Despite an overall increase since 1994, GDP per capita has not shown consistent improvements over the last 15 years. Data from the World Bank suggests that by this indicator, the economy has yet to fully recover from successive dips following the global recession and then the Covid-19 pandemic. GDP per capita was $6,022 in 2022, less than it was in 2008, when the figure was $6,074 . And the country's economy, Rossouw said, had slipped relative to other countries.

        "doc": "Rise Mzansi was correct in its assertions about unemployment in South Africa, including that it affects black women the most, the majority of whom live below the poverty line. While there is evidence that millions of South Africans don't meet their daily nutritional needs, as the party said, the claim that food insecurity and hunger have increased since 1994 is unproven. The party's manifesto under-reports the number of South Africans living with disabilities, and a statement about inequality in the country needs to be clarified in an important way. The new kid on the block, Rise Mzansi, launched its election manifesto on 20 January 2024. The People's Manifesto was compiled after \"almost a year of listening and discussion with hundreds of communities across\" South Africa, Rise Mzansi said. The political party was formed in April 2023 and is contesting its first national election in 2024. The word \"Mzansi\", derived from isiXhosa, is a widely used informal name for the country South Africa. The manifesto sets out the party's priorities in five key areas : leadership, safety, the economy, community and climate. When a reader asked us to fact-check one of the claims made in the document, we took the opportunity to look into a number of others. Here's what we found. Rise Mzansi identifies p roviding skills training opportunities for people who have not completed school as an \"urgent priority\". According to the party, half of all unemployed South Africans did not matriculate. Matric refers to South Africa's high school leaving qualification, formally known as the national senior certificate . We asked Rise Mzansi for the source of this and other claims made in their manifesto. They referred Africa Check to a page on Statista , an online subscription-based statistics provider. This showed the proportion of unemployed people in South Africa in the second quarter of 2023, by level of education. In this quarter (from April to June), 7.9 million people were unemployed. Of these, 50.1% had not completed high school. Just over 40% had matriculated, while 2.4% were university graduates. The source of the data is Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), the country's data agency, which tracks employment figures through its quarterly labour force survey . According to Stats SA, these figures show the importance of education in reducing unemployment rates. The unemployment rates for those with a matric or less were above the national rate, while the unemployment rates for those with other tertiary qualifications and university graduates were below the national rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that disability is an integral part of the human experience. A priority for Rise Mzansi is to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the human rights afforded to all South Africans. \"The data on the number of South Africans living with a disability varies widely,\" the party told Africa Check. They directed us to a 2021 presentation by the City of Johannesburg on the demographic profile of people living with disabilities. According to the presentation, in 2019 6.6% of South Africans aged five years and older were classified as having a disability. This was 3.5 million people. Rise Mzansi also sent Africa Check an infographic from the National Council of and for Persons with Disabilities , an organisation that represents the interests of people with disabilities. This says that 15% of South Africans have a disability. Bernadette Rigney, the organisation's public relations manager, said the figure was based on statistics from the WHO and the International Labour Organization . The percentage is consistent with data from Stats SA, which records the number of people living with disabilities in its general household surveys. These ask each member of a household to rate their ability to perform a range of activities, such as seeing, hearing, walking or climbing a flight of stairs, remembering and concentrating, caring for themselves, and communicating in their most commonly used language. People who struggle with two or more of the activities, those who have a lot of difficulty with one or more of the activities and those who are completely unable to do any one of the activities are classified as disabled. According to Stats SA, 9.6 million people over five met this definition in 2022. This was 15.7% of the population \u2013 and higher (17.4%) if those under five in the general population were excluded. Rise Mzansi understated the figure. Inequality is the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, rights and power among individuals, groups or communities. The nature and extent of inequality can have a significant impact on the overall well-being, cohesion and functioning of a society. In South Africa inequality is most often viewed through an economic lens . Economic inequality refers to significant differences in how much an individual or group earns, owns or consumes. The Gini index is the most widely used estimate of economic inequality. It provides a score for comparing inequality, called the Gini coefficient . It is a number on a scale from 0, which represents perfect equality, to 1, which represents complete inequality. For income, a value of 0 would mean that everyone has the same income, and a value of 1 would mean that one person receives all the income and everyone else gets nothing. Data from the World Bank As its source for this claim, Rise Mzansi referred us to a 2022 World Bank report that looked at inequality in five African countries that make up \"the world's most unequal region\", as measured by the Gini index and other tools. According to the report, South Africa was \"the most unequal country in the world\", ranking first out of 164 countries in the bank's poverty database. The most recent estimates put South Africa's Gini coefficient at 0.63 or 0.67 , depending on whether consumption or income was used. Our World in Data , a research and data project in collaboration with the University of Oxford, produces visualisations showing Gini coefficients around the world using the latest available consumption or income data. While South Africa topped the list, other African countries such as Namibia and Zambia had similarly high coefficients of over 0.5 . By comparison, most European countries had values in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 , while the United States scored 0.42 . The World Bank's report also looked at wealth inequality . It estimated that the top 10% of the population held 71% of the wealth in South Africa, compared to the top 10% holding 50% of the wealth in a group of high-income countries . The bottom 60% of the population shared just 7% of South Africa's wealth, compared with 13% in the high-income countries. Comparing apples, oranges and unknowns While the World Bank's data is widely considered to be of high quality and reliable , there are problems with cross-country comparisons. The absence of data from various countries in many years from the bank's database should be considered. Gini data for Gulf countries , such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar, is limited , despite other evidence of high inequality in the region. Other countries, such as Afghanistan, Libya and Argentina, also appear to be missing. Rise Mzansi acknowledged the limitations of the tool, as not every country was included in the calculations. \"But this does not [detract] from the generally accepted view that South Africa is the most unequal country,\" the party said. Prof Imraan Valodia directs the Southern Centre for Inequality Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. He told Africa Check that the claim remains factually correct. However, he stressed that the statement should be qualified by saying that South Africa's Gini is the \"highest in the world of countries for which we have data\". The World Bank has detailed other limitations of the Gini index. For example, it says there are often differences in the surveys used by different countries to collect data. As a result, there may be some bias in comparisons between countries, but the bank says it has \"made an effort to ensure that the data are as comparable as possible\". As evidence for this claim, Rise Mzansi referred us to the South Africa National Human Development Report 2022 , compiled by the United Nations Development Programme and the South African government. In it, the authors break down unemployment data from two quarters in 2021 and conclude that unemployment was higher among black African women than other demographic groups, with rates ranging from 41% to 41.5%. The report draws its data from Stats SA, which publishes the results of national labour force surveys every three months. Africa Check contacted Stats SA for the latest numbers.   The data shows that, according to the official or \"strict\" definition, unemployment among black women ranged between 38.4% and 39.9% from the third quarter of 2022 to the same period in 2023. This was higher than for black men, women of other races, and the national average. Figures under the extended definition of unemployment, which includes discouraged jobseekers, show the same trend, with higher rates for black women (ranging from 49.2% to 51.4%) compared to black men, women of other races or the national average. We therefore consider this claim to be correct. Poverty in South Africa is usually measured using poverty lines (although there are many other methods ). Poverty lines are estimates of the amount of money a person needs each month to afford certain items for their survival. The upper-bound poverty line indicates the point at which someone can afford a list of specific essential food and non-food items. The lower-bound poverty line is the point at which someone cannot afford to buy both essential food and non-food items, so they sacrifice food to buy other essentials. The food poverty line is the amount of money needed to meet only the daily minimum energy requirement. When asked for the data behind this claim, Rise Mzansi said they relied on Stats SA reports. Specifically, they steered us to the Poverty Trends in South Africa report. Published in 2017, it looked at data from 2006 to 2015. In it, the authors noted that there was \"still a significant [difference] in poverty levels between population groups and the sex of individuals\". According to the report, black women made up the largest proportion of people living below the lower-bound poverty line in 2011 and 2015. The authors noted that black women were \"the main victims in the ongoing struggle against poverty\", along with children, people from rural areas, those with no education and those living in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces. Africa Check contacted Stats SA about this claim. Werner Ruch, director of poverty and inequality statistics, confirmed that black women were more likely to live below the poverty line than other groups. Ruch provided data on the percentage of people living in poverty broken down by gender and race, based on the 2014/15 Living Conditions Survey . He confirmed that this was the most recent data available. According to the data, in 2015 31.7% of black women lived below the food poverty line, 49.2% below the lower-bound poverty line, and 66.3% below the upper-bound poverty line. This means that for every three black women in South Africa, two are estimated to be living in poverty.  A report published by Stats SA in 2023 used the results of the 2021 general household survey (GHS) to assess \"food inadequacy and hunger\" in South Africa. It found that roughly 6% of South African households (about 1.12 million households) had \"severely inadequate access to food\". A further 15% (about 2.6 million households) had \"inadequate\" access to food. These households represent millions of South Africans. To determine whether a household had adequate access to food, the GHS asked respondents whether, in the 12 months before the survey, there had been times when their household had been \"unable to eat healthy and nutritious food because of lack of money or other resources\" or \"had to skip a meal because of lack of money or other resources\". Households that answered \"yes\" to at least two of the eight questions were considered to have \"inadequate\" access to food. Those who answered yes to at least six were considered to have \"severely inadequate access to food\". In response to Africa Check's queries, Rise Mzansi quoted the 2021 GHS and also pointed out that 11.6% of households were identified as being \"vulnerable to hunger\" in that survey. This figure remained the same in 2022 . First, this claim is less straightforward than the previous one, as Rise Mzansi acknowledged: \"It is difficult to determine how the nature of hunger and/or food insecurity has changed since 1994, as there are not consistent measures of hunger and malnutrition from that period to now.\" To support this statement, the party pointed us to a 2017 press release from the University of Pretoria. This said that a review of 169 surveys on food insecurity in South Africa found that most \"used one or more of 27 different measures of food insecurity\". But as evidence of this claim, Rise Mzansi also said: \"The Food and Agriculture Organization's measure of the prevalence of food inadequacy, which looks at the percentage of people who have sufficient calories for physical activity stood at 23% of the population in 1994. \"But this measure does not encompass all aspects of food insecurity and hunger. The SANHANES research uses a wider measure of food insecurity and hunger and found that in 2013 the proportion of people at risk of hunger may have increased to 28%.\" The South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , or SANHANES, was carried out in 2012. This answer, however, is copied almost word for word from a paragraph in a 2014 report by the international charity Oxfam . But Rise Mzansi omitted two key clauses. The first said that the percentage of people with enough calories for physical activity had \"declined to under 10% in 2012\" from the 23% recorded by the  United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1994. The second, regarding the SANHANES data, said that \"food insecurity, or hunger, has halved since 1999, but that the level has stagnated since 2008 and remains at 26%\". This suggests that food insecurity or hunger was less than 26% in 1999. This data contradicts Rise Mzansi's claim, but the Oxfam report was published a decade ago. So we looked for more recent statistics. Data mostly points to lower prevalence of hunger, but not all agree The GHS only started in 2002, but its predecessor, the October Household Survey (OHS), was conducted until 1999. In 1994 , 41% of households reported that there had been a time in the past year when there was not enough money to feed the children in the household. This fell to 31.7% the following year. The latest GHS found that only 12.9% of people and 11.6% of households in 2022 were \"vulnerable to hunger\". While both the OHS and GHS ask similar questions about access to food, as we've written before , they are not entirely compatible. Neil Roux, Stats SA's director of service delivery statistics, told Africa Check that \"comparing data from the GHS with the OHS remains tricky due to variations between the samples used between 1993 and 1999 together with issues related to the questionnaire design\". Despite some work to make the OHS and GHS data more compatible, these and other differences cause difficulties when comparing the surveys. Conflicting data from trustworthy sources The latest GHS itself shows a pattern in which vulnerability to hunger has mostly declined over the past two decades, from 24.2% in 2002 , apart from a brief increase during the Covid pandemic. The graph below, taken from the 2022 GHS, shows this pattern, as well as a corresponding pattern in what Stats SA calls \"complex food access\". This is a measure of food access based on several questions about a household's access to food over the past 12 months. The FAO has however found an increase in food insecurity. According to the UN agency, the prevalence of severe and moderate food insecurity in South Africa has increased from a three-year average of 17.4% in 2017-2019 to 20.3% in 2020-2022. But there are some caveats to this. The FAO uses data from the Gallup World Poll , which asks the same questions as the GHS. However, whereas the Gallup poll consists of \"at least 1,000 surveys of individuals\", the GHS surveyed 19,351 households in 2022 . Of the two, the general household survey is more likely to be reliable and representative of South Africa. Without being able to compare recent data with historical figures, we rate the claim unproven. At Africa Check, we use this rating when publicly available information neither proves nor disproves the claim. This report is produced as part of the work of a South African election coalition . In the run-up to the 2024 national elections, the coalition aims to ensure that the claims made by those in charge of state resources and delivering essential services are factually accurate. As voters head to the polls, it is increasingly important that they are able to make informed decisions.",

But the state government says this is not true. \"Those that are seeking for job, most especially, our Youths should go and get this form from the Oyo State Hospital Management Board,\" begins a post on Facebook. Oyo state is located in the southwest of Nigeria, bordering Kwara state to the north and Ogun state to the south. The 11 January 2024 post also explains the application process in four steps: Step 1: Go to Oyo State Hospital Management Board, Room 14 at Oyo State Secretariat to get code. Step 2: Go to Polaris Bank with the code and pay the sum of #2500. Step 3: Take the teller to the office of Oyo State Accountant General to confirm payment. Step 4: Take the confirmed teller to Room 14 of Oyo State Hospital Management Board to get the form, fill it and submit there. It claims that the state government is recruiting \" doctors, nurses and other workers\". The unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 4.2% in the second quarter of 2023. So posts about job opportunities, especially government jobs, will be of interest to many Nigerians. The same directions can be found on Facebook here , here , here , here , here and here . But is the Oyo state government hiring and is a N2,500 application fee required? We checked. Disregard false information, state government says Africa Check searched the internet for official confirmation of the claim and found none. According to the Leadership news site, the Oyo state administration has denied claims that it is recruiting medical personnel. The state commissioner for information and orientation, Prince Dotun Oyelade, told the media: \"It has come to the attention of the state government that some unscrupulous elements are peddling false information on purported sales of application forms for employment of Medical Personnel into the State service. The Oyo State Government hereby wishes to categorically state that there are currently no sales of such forms as the process for eventual recruitment is still ongoing.\" The state government also took to X (formerly Twitter) to debunk the claim. Posts that directly ask for an application fee are a sure red flag . Fact-checking ensures that people don't lose money to job scams. Read our guide to Facebook scam and how to spot them here .",

But this zombie claim is still false. \"Pictures are going to be uploaded of the fighting in Jewish settlements on WhatsApp,\" starts a message circulating on WhatsApp and sent to Africa Check multiple times by our subscribers. The claim warns that these photos come in the form of a \"seismic waves card\" and will hack your phone \"in 10 seconds and cannot be stopped in any way\". The message then tells readers to share the information with family and friends. The same claim has also made its way onto Facebook and is doing the rounds in South Africa here , here , here and here . It's being shared as war rages in the Gaza Strip , a small Palestinian territory on the Mediterranean coast bordered by Egypt and Israel . Palestinians are mostly Muslim, while Israel is the world's only Jewish state. The Israeli army has waged war on the territory since Hamas , the militant Islamic group which rules Gaza, attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 . However, violent conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people goes back decades. It includes Israelis settling areas in the West Bank considered Palestinian territory by international law, often referred to as Jewish settlements . Since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war , also known as the Israel-Gaza war, Africa Check has fact-checked many false claims made about the conflict . But what is this \"seismic waves card\" showing photos of \"fighting in Jewish settlements\"? And will it hack your phone in 10 seconds? We checked. Malware is real, but the claim lacks evidence Files or links that can hack your phone or computer when opened are called malware . Malware, or malicious software, has been designed to infiltrate devices and compromise or damage data. Since malware is considered an umbrella term for a range of online threats, many different forms exist. These range from adware , which shows ads on a device screen and can capture user data, to ransomware , which locks users out of their systems or data until a ransom is paid. However, there is no type of malware called a \"seismic waves card\". Africa Check previously found that searching for the term on Google only returned only other instances of the same claim. Do not open links and files if you can't verify their authenticity If you're not sure, don't open any suspicious files or links without checking their origin or authenticity. US computer security company McAfee offers advice on how to protect yourself from malware: Install antivirus software to keep malware at bay. Be wary of suspicious-looking websites and what files you download. Use strong passwords. Don't open files or click on links from people you don't know. Back up your data regularly. Zombie claims: red flags we can learn from Zombie claims are claims that circulate on social media for years, with the message only changing slightly each time. For example, this claim is only slightly different from a claim we previously fact-checked. Instead of warning about \"pictures of the fighting in Jewish settlements\", a previous version warned of \"photos of the Moroccan earthquake \". This is a classic example of zombie claims , the ones that just won't die, even though they've been debunked before.  The wording has been changed to make the claim appear more current, but it's still false. You can play your part in stopping these claims from resurrecting by following our tips .",

The Facebook accounts HE Aisharh Jumaa Kattana , Hon Aishah jumwaa katana loan , HE Aisharh Jumwua Kattarna , Mum Aisha Katana and HE Aisha Juma Katana have advertised loans on Facebook. Each of the accounts uses the name of Kenyan politician Aisha Jumwa (though misspelled), the cabinet secretary for gender, culture, arts and heritage . The accounts also use her photos as either their profile picture, cover photo or both. They also list various contacts to be used for the loan applications. They offer different loan amounts and promise users instant withdrawals to their M-Pesa accounts. M-Pesa is a mobile financial service by Safaricom , Kenya's largest telecoms company. Posts can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are these accounts to be trusted? We checked. Imposter accounts The first hint that these are all fake accounts is that they have misspelled her name or added an extra unusual title to it, such as \"mum\". Poor spelling is often a sign that an account or page is fake. The second indication that the accounts might be fake is that they all have few followers or friends, and have poorly written and repetitive posts. Most Kenyan politicians in influential positions in government have large social media followings and post well-written messages. All the accounts claim the loans are from Inua Jamii, the Kenyan government programme that provides cash grants to poor and vulnerable people. But the programme does not give out loans. Jumwa's official Facebook page Hon. Aisha Jumwa Katana is verified and has over 293,000 followers. It features posts about her daily activities and whereabouts. It makes no mention of any loan offers and publishes well-written messages with no obvious grammatical errors. The accounts in question are all fake.

But this is a misunderstanding of what Disease X is \u2013 a placeholder name \u2013 and false. \"WEF Admits Disease X Will Be Unleashed In 2025,\" reads the headline of identical articles circulating on social media in Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and elsewhere since late January 2024. The World Economic Forum , or WEF, is an organisation that encourages governments and the private sector to cooperate on important global issues. It is often the target of false conspiracy theories . The article was published on 23 January by The People's Voice . The website, previously known as News Punch , is widely known to spread false information . The piece has since been republished on several other websites and blogs . Its blurb reads : \"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has declared that 'Disease X' will be unleashed onto the public by the year 2025 \u2013 and the consequences will be devastating for humanity.\" The claim also appears here , here , here , here , here , here and here . It echoes the thoroughly debunked Plandemic conspiracy theory that the global Covid outbreak was secretly planned by global elites that included drug companies, Bill Gates and the World Health Organization (WHO). But Disease X doesn't exist. And WEF didn't \"admit\" that it would be \"unleashed\" in 2025. Placeholder name for hypothetical disease Disease X is a placeholder name for a possible unknown disease that may break out unexpectedly. It's used in discussions about whether the world is prepared for another global pandemic and ways to reduce the harm of such an outbreak. The name was first coined in the WHO's 2018 review of diseases in urgent need of research and development, known as the R&D Blueprint . The blueprint aims to reduce the time between when a serious disease is declared a public health emergency and when diagnostic tests, vaccines and other treatments become available. It came out of the 2014 Ebola outbreak that killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa and spread to a few cases in the US and Europe. The 2018 R&D Blueprint lists eight diseases in \"urgent need\" of \"accelerated research and development\". Seven are existing diseases, such as Ebola , Zika and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( Sars). The eighth is the unknown Disease X, which represents \"the awareness that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently not recognized to cause human disease\". Disease X doesn't exist and once a previously unknown disease becomes known, it will be given its own name. 'Preparing for Disease X' session at WEF annual meeting On 17 January 2024, the WEF's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland held a session titled \" Preparing for Disease X \". Participants included WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus . Its description reads: \"With the World Health Organization continuing to research the potential of so-called 'Disease X', what novel efforts are needed to prepare healthcare systems for the multiple challenges ahead?\" At no point in the session did any of the speakers \"admit\" that Disease X would be \"unleashed\" in 2025. The claim is false.",

However, claims that the central bank governor said the local currency would trade as low as KSh130 to the dollar by the end of the month are false. \"We expect the dollar to drop to SHs.130 by end of February,\" reads a graphic doing the rounds on Facebook in Kenya. It attributes the quote to the governor of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), Kamau Thugge. The graphic shows an image of Thugge and the logo of Kenyans.co.ke , a digital news outlet, implying that they published it. The graphic was posted on 15 February 2024, the day the Kenyan shilling strengthened significantly against the US dollar. The CBK reported that $1 was trading at KSh153.2 on the day, down from KSh156.71 the previous day. This marked one of the currency's strongest gains in years. The shilling had fallen to a low of KSh161.36 in January. The graphic has been posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is the claim and the graphic to be trusted? We checked. 'This never came from us' While such a statement would have been picked up by the mainstream media given the keen interest in the fortunes of the local currency, we did not find such a quote broadcast or published anywhere. The graphic can't be found on the Kenyans.co.ke Facebook or Twitter pages. Africa Check contacted Brian Muuo, the head of social media at Kenyans.co.ke, about the graphic. \"This never came from us, it's fake. Our inhouse style guide for writing Kenyan money is always Ksh and not Shs as in the graphic in circulation,\" he told us. We have found no evidence that Thugge said this, or that any media house quoted him as saying it.",

A letter alleging that up to 600 \"Nation\" staff may be declared redundant by April 2024 is part of a disinformation attack. An internal memo, apparently from the chief executive of one of Kenya's largest publishers, Nation Media Group (NMG), contains worrying news. \"I wish to notify all members of staff of the Company's intention to declare redundancy of 600 employees across various departments at the end of Q1 (April 2024),\" reads the memo circulating online. It is titled \"NOTICE OF INTENTION TO DECLARE REDUNDANCY\". The document lists the reasons for the redundancies, including falling revenues, and how staff will be compensated. The memo is dated 5 February 2024. NMG lists 30 brands in four countries \u2013 Kenya, where it is headquartered, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. It is a listed company in all four. As a major independent news publisher, it is often the target of inauthentic coordinated attacks online. In the first months of 2024, the hashtag #RIPNationMedia was an example of this, where posters used doctored images and videos and fabricated stories in an apparent attempt to discredit Nation Media journalists. This came as the publisher investigated dysfunction in the delivery of basic government services. This was not the first time the company had been targeted online. In June 2023, trade cabinet secretary Moses Kuria publicly warned government departments against advertising with the media house after NMG published an expos\u00e9 that touched on the ministry. The memo has been posted on Facebook here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . If authentic, the memo would worry many given its reach, from staff and audiences to investors and suppliers. But did the company's chief exec send such a memo? We checked. Red flags An online search for the memo turns up no credible media reports. This is the first red flag: if the memo were real, it would have been widely reported in the media. Secondly, the document is unsigned, which is unusual for an official communication from a major media company. On 9 February, NMG posted the circulating document on its official social media pages, with the word \"fake\" printed in red across it. \"We wish to notify you that this poster and the content contained is FAKE!\" reads their post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. The company has also published an editorial about the attacks. The \"redundancy\" memo is fake and should be ignored.",

But the photo is of a bomb blast that claimed more than 21 lives in 2014, \"Expl0sion rocks Maitama, Abuja today, on Ikeja Cantonment Bomb Blast Remembrance Day,\" reads a post on a Facebook page with over 70,000 followers. The post features a photo of burning vehicles. Maitama is a district in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. On 27 January 2022 , a fire broke out in a market in Abuja and spread to the nearby Ikeja military cantonment, where \"high calibre bombs\" were stored. Several bombs detonated and over 1,000 people died trying to flee the scene. However, the posts claiming there had been another explosion in January 2024 were published before 27 January, the anniversary of the Ikeja blast. Nigeria has been grappling with kidnappings , gang attacks and explosions for years. An explosion took place in the Ibadan area of Oyo state on 16 January 2024. According to officials , the explosion was the result of the illegal storage of explosives in a residential area. In a separate incident, gunmen attacked some communities in Plateau state on 24 December 2023, killing over 70 people. The same claim about a Maitama blast can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . It also made its way to X (formerly Twitter) and received over 30,000 views. But does the circulating photo show an explosion in Maitama? We checked. Image dates back to 2014 Using Google reverse image search, Africa Check found that the image of the burning cars has been online since 2014. According to an NBC News report , at least 21 people were killed in twin car bombings outside an upmarket shopping mall in Abuja on 25 June of that year. Another 52 people were injured. We found the same image in a BBC report on the same incident. Meanwhile, the Abuja police and the emergency management agency have denied reports of a bomb blast in Maitama in January 2024. According to officials , a metal refuse container overheated and exploded , injuring two people. No cars were affected in the incident. Using an image of burning vehicles to illustrate an unrelated event can exaggerate its impact, especially in a country with security challenges, such as Nigeria. Fact-checking helps to ensure that images are properly documented for future reference.",

The Facebook pages Fuliza Increment loans , Fuliza Increase Limit and To increase fuliza limit from 0 to 50,000 claim they can increase the borrowing limit on Kenya's popular Fuliza service. Fuliza is an overdraft service run by Safaricom , Kenya's largest telecoms company, in partnership with two of the country's biggest banks. The service allows M-Pesa mobile money users to complete a transaction even if they don't have enough money in their account. M-Pesa is Safaricom's mobile money transfer and payment service . One of the page's posts, dated 7 February 2024, reads : \"Is your FULIZA limit Kshs0.00 or it remains at sh300 No need worry we can increase your FULIZA limit up to Ksh.50,000 Whitin 5 minutes only.\" The pages have posted the offers here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are these pages to be trusted? We checked. Fake pages According to Safaricom, M-Pesa customers who registered using their national identity cards can activate Fuliza, but not all are eligible for a credit limit upon activation. It said that those who had been on its network for less than six months would have a \"zero limit\". The allocation of the limit would later be \"based on their line's activity\". \"To grow the Fuliza limit, you need to continue using Safaricom and M-PESA services and repay your Fuliza M-PESA facility on time by topping up your M-PESA account,\" the company said . So it's misleading for the Facebook pages to claim they can increase the limit. We also noticed that two of the pages promised to raise the Fuliza limit to KSh75,000. This is a big red flag as the company has stated that the minimum a customer can send using the Fuliza service is KSh1 and the maximum is KSh70,000. The page's requests for users to engage privately by sending a message could be an attempt to scam people. All signs point to fake Facebook pages with scam offers.",

Several Facebook posts claim that the Nigerian government wants to convert US$30 billion (about N27 trillion) in domiciliary accounts into naira, in order to save the local currency. A domiciliary account is a type of account that allows Nigerians to make transactions in foreign currencies using local banks. This type of account is particularly useful for individuals and companies that trade internationally, travel frequently or need to make and receive payments in foreign currencies. A 3 February 2024 post reads : \"Operation Rescue Naira: FG considers converting $30bn domiciliary deposits to naira.\" The Nigerian naira continues to weaken against foreign currencies such as the dollar, pound and euro. The naira reportedly hit a new low against the dollar between January and February 2024. The weakness of the local currency means that people's purchasing power is reduced as imported goods become more expensive. The depreciation of the naira is also taking its toll on foreign investors . Several users have posted the claim here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is the Nigerian government considering converting $30 billion into naira? We checked. 'Allegation is absolutely false' In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) denied the rumours. The 3 January 2024 post reads , in part: \"This allegation is absolutely false and aims to trigger panic in the foreign exchange market, which the CBN is working assiduously to stabilise, as evidenced by its recent work and policy directions.\" In what it calls an act of \"national sabotage\", the bank urges stakeholders to disregard stories aimed at causing panic. Several news organisations also reported the CBN's denial of the rumour. Misinformation or rumours about government economic policies can have adverse effects on the economy.

        "doc": "Zibi was correct about the backlog in issuing mining licences, despite the South African economy's reliance on this sector, and that unemployment was higher in 2024 than in 1994. The party leader was also on the money when it came to South Africa spending more on servicing national debt than on policing, health or infrastructure, while also splashing out R2 billion a year on protection services' blue-light brigades for politicians and VIPs. He also correctly stated violent crime is worse today than 20 years ago, but his statement that 48 out of every 100 kids who started school in 2012 did not matriculate in 2023 is misleading. The newly formed Rise Mzansi party launched its election manifesto in January 2024. We fact-checked seven claims made in the document and found that the party was correct in its claims about unemployment in South Africa, including that it affects black women the most. The party's claims about hunger, disability and inequality were less definitive. Launching the manifesto, party leader Songezo Zibi said South Africa was in serious trouble: \"Although many people believe politics is a game of promises, smoke and mirrors, to us this is no game. This is a life and death situation.\" Zibi supported this statement by making several claims about where the country stood. We take a closer look at them in this report. Speaking about the party's plan to \"remove obstacles to investment and support small businesses and entrepreneurs\", Zibi said there was a backlog of over 2,000 mining licences in the country. South Africa's mining industry employed just under 450,000 people between October and December 2023 and contributed 58% of the country's total exports in the first six months of the same year. No person or organisation can legally mine or prospect in South Africa without a mining licence issued by the department of mineral resources and energy . Rise Mzansi said the source of the claim was an article published on 15 January 2024 by Miningmx , an online African mining news and analysis publication. According to Miningmx, 2,525 mining permits were not processed in the 2023/24 financial year. The source of the figure, according to the article, was a report by South African news site Daily Maverick. According to the Daily Maverick, mineral resources minister Gwede Mantashe said in a written response to a question in parliament on 8 December 2023 that 2,525 applications for mining licences were received in the 2023/24 financial year and that none had been finalised. Mantashe gave an update on the backlog on 5 February at the mining indaba , an event dedicated to the development of mining interests in Africa. He said that his department had, since December, granted \"268 prospecting rights, 32 mining rights, 85 renewals, 184 amendments, and 190 permits\". While some progress has since been made, Zibi's claim was correct when he made it. As evidence for this claim, Rise Mzansi referred us to the national treasury's latest budget statement for figures on debt service costs . The treasury defines this as the cost of interest on government debt. According to the foreword to the statement, written by finance minister Enoch Godongwana, for every R5 the government collects in revenue, it spends R1 on servicing its debt. Rising debt costs , he said, now consume more of the budget than basic education, social protection and health. According to expenditure figures in the 2023/24 budget, the government was expected to spend R340.5 billion on debt servicing. This compares to R259.2 billion allocated to health. Just under R228 billion was allocated to peace and security, which includes police services. Almost R238 billion was allocated to economic development, which includes infrastructure. The treasury expects debt servicing costs to rise to R385.9 billion in 2024/25 and R425.5 billion in 2025/26. These rising figures crowd out spending on service delivery, it says. Rise Mzansi's claim about South Africa's debt servicing is correct. Rise Mzansi steered us to World Bank data showing unemployment as a percentage of the labour force over time. The labour force is the part of the population that is or wants to be economically active. As we've written before , employment experts say this is a more useful measure of unemployment trends than using raw numbers, because the latter doesn't take into account changes in the labour force. The source of the World Bank data was the International Labour Organization (ILO). The data shows that in 2003 the proportion of the labour force that was unemployed was 20%. By 2022, the latest year for which data is available, this had risen to 29.8%. These figures come from Statistics South Africa's labour surveys. Although the ILO rates are slightly different, the trend is the same \u2013 the proportion of the labour force that was unemployed has generally increased since 2003. (To explain the slight difference, the ILO said different analyses were carried out compared to national statistics.) As Africa Check has previously reported , it is difficult to compare data before and after 2008 because the surveys used to measure unemployment changed in 2008 . Stats SA has published revisions to some pre-2008 unemployment data which are more comparable. The revised official unemployment rate was recorded as 24.8% in 2003, compared to 31.9% in 2023. The expanded unemployment rate, which includes people who aren't actively looking for work, is another indicator used by Stats SA. However, without revised expanded rates for pre-2008 data, comparisons between then and now are not straightforward. Are we asking the wrong questions? While unemployment appears to be higher than it was 20 years ago according to the comparable data available, there may be more to the story. Dr Neva Makgetla , senior economist at the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies research institute, told Africa Check that unemployment data tells us \"what people want and are looking for\" rather than if people have income-generating work. In terms of measuring demand for work, Makgetla said the official definition of unemployment could be used. But when looking at exclusion from the economy, the absorption rate is a better indicator as it measures how much of South Africa's working-age population is employed. According to revised statistics , the absorption rate has been relatively stable since the early 2000s, largely in the 40 to 45% range, with a dip during the Covid pandemic. \"Blue light brigades\" is the informal term used in South Africa for the escort and protection services that accompany politicians, visiting diplomats and other influential people on the roads. The services are called this because of the blue lights on their vehicles. Officially, \"blue light brigades\" are a specific programme of the South African Police Service (SAPS) known as VIP protection services . Blue light brigades have been controversial for decades . In a July 2023 incident, the protection unit of deputy president Paul Mashatile was filmed assaulting civilians on a busy South African highway. Rise Mzansi referred Africa Check to national treasury expenditure estimates as the source of its claim. These estimated that about R1.97 billion was spent on VIP protection services in the 2022/23 financial year, an increase on the previous years' expenditure of R1.86 billion (2021/22), R1.66 billion (2020/21) and R1.85 billion (2019/20). The treasury estimated that this expenditure would increase in subsequent years, exceeding the R2 billion mark in 2024/25. With previous years rounded up to two billion, including the outlier year 2020/21, which included the start of the Covid pandemic and associated travel restrictions, we rate this claim as correct. Rise Mzansi said it relied on statistics from the Crime Hub , a database run by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), an independent research organisation based in Pretoria. The party said it had used murder \"as a proxy for violent crime\" in making this claim. Violent crime, classified by the South African Police Service (SAPS) under \" contact crime \", includes offences such as murder, rape, assault and robbery. While the SAPS reports statistics on all contact crimes, there is often a gap between the number of crimes committed and how many are reported to the police or other organisations. This is estimated to be the case for many crimes, particularly rape and assault, for a variety of reasons . Under-reporting of murders is less common. This is because murder statistics can be independently tracked and verified, Gareth Newham , head of the ISS Justice and Violence Prevention Programme, told Africa Check. \"Dead bodies are hard to hide, dispute or ignore,\" says the ISS. And comparing police murder rates with mortuary records suggests that police statistics are likely to be relatively accurate. This means that murder is considered \"the most reliable crime indicator\", Newham said, so trends in murder rates are often used as a proxy, or representation, of the larger trends in violent crime. According to police crime statistics, more than 27,000 people were murdered in South Africa in 2022/23. However, to compare this with previous years, changes in the population must be taken into account. To do this, experts usually report the number of murders per 100,000 people in the country. In 2023, the murder rate was 45 per 100,000 , slightly higher than the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimate of 41 per 100,000 in 2003. The larger trend The ISS has analysed murder trends in South Africa since the 1970s. As Africa Check has previously reported , the murder rate fell steadily from the end of the apartheid era, more than halving between 1994/5 and 2011/12. But in the years since, the rate has risen almost every year, increasing by over 52%. [ISS infographic murder trends] According to Newham, the police's ability to solve murders declined during this period, despite significant increases in its budget. He added that the SAPS was plagued by an \"inability to address deficiencies in recruitment, training, resource allocation, performance management and accountability\". For Newham, this means that although the murder rate is only slightly higher in 2024 than it was two decades ago, the trend is clear: violent crime is worse now than it was 20 years ago. He added that over the past two decades, more violent crime appeared to be the result of organised crime and inter-group violence than interpersonal violence: \"Increasingly, illegal mining, taxi violence, hijackings and other robberies are driving the increase in murders.\" There were also more mass shootings, where three or more people were killed in one incident, and more vigilante killings as public trust in the police declined , Newham said. At the same time, the state's intelligence and policing capabilities were \"much stronger\" 20 years previously than in 2024, as a result of state capture. South Africa's high school leaving qualification is known as \"matric\", formally the national senior certificate (NSC). In January 2024, basic education minister Angie Motshekga announced that 82.9% of learners who sat the NSC exams in 2023 had passed, which was a record pass rate. The matric pass rate is a contested topic in South Africa: some opposition political parties and non-governmental organisations claim that this pass rate ignores the number of learners who dropped out of school before reaching matric. They say that the \" real matric pass rate \" should be calculated by dividing the number of learners who completed matric by the number who entered grade 1, 12 years earlier. For example, in the case of the class of 2023, 572,983 learners obtained their NSC, but 1,208,973 enrolled in grade 1 in 2012. This means that only 47% of the cohort successfully reached grade 12 and completed their high school education, which is very close to Zibi's claim. However, the basic education department has challenged these calculations, arguing that they ignore various factors that lead to a decline in the number of learners \u2013 in particular, learners repeating grades. Instead, the department calculates the dropout rate by subtracting the percentage of learners who completed the previous year's grade from the percentage who enrolled in the following year's grade. For example, if 70% of the learners who passed grade 5 enrol in grade 6, the dropout rate for grade 5 would be 30%. Particular attention is paid to grade 7 , the level the department uses as a measure of literacy; grade 9 , the final year of compulsory education; and grade 12, the completion of the cohort's basic education. Survival rates v dropout rates Rise Mzansi said its source for the claim was a 2024 report by Zero Dropout , a national campaign to reduce dropout rates. The latest report on the Zero Dropout website is from 2023 and claims that \"only 40% of learners that begin grade 1 complete matric\". It attributes this statistic to a 2023 report by the basic education department and Stats SA. The report does include a section on dropout and survival rates . According to the report, the survival rate per grade is the percentage of a cohort of learners enrolled in the first grade in a given school year who are expected to reach a given grade. As shown in the table above, the survival rate for learners born between 1995 and 1997 (and surveyed between 2019 and 2021) was 99.3% when they entered grade 1. This figure decreases with each grade, gradually at first and then quite sharply from grade 9 onwards. But the survival rate is not the same as the dropout rate , also shown in the table. This is defined in the report as the percentage of all people who complete a particular grade and complete no further education. In other words, they are assumed to have dropped out after that grade. The table above shows that the percentage of learners completing grade 12 has increased over time, from 41% for those born between 1979 and 1981 to 58% for those born between 1995 and 1997. In contrast to the dropout rate, this measure gives a better indication of the proportion of young people who eventually pass matric. We therefore consider this claim to be misleading. This report is produced as part of the work of a South African election coalition . In the run-up to the 2024 national elections, the coalition aims to ensure that the claims made by those in charge of state resources and delivering essential services are factually accurate. As voters head to the polls, it is increasingly important that they are able to make informed decisions.",

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Several claims that Nigeria's former leader Muhammadu Buhari died in 2017 are false, as are claims that his wife confirmed this in 2024. During Muhammadu Buhari 's tenure as president of Nigeria, there were several false claims in 2017 and 2018 that he had died. These included during his repeated visits to the United Kingdom for treatment of an undisclosed illness. Buhari served two terms as president of Nigeria. The first from 2015 to 2019 and the second from 2019 to 2023. However, claims have surfaced on Facebook in 2024, including here , here , and here , that his wife Aisha said he died in 2017 while on a medical trip to the UK. One of the posts reads , in part: \"My real husband Buhari died in 2017 in the UK before a Sudanese man who mimics people's characters was paid and clown to act like my late husband - Aisha Buhari Former First Lady of Nigeria opened up.\" In December 2018, Buhari denied that he had died and been replaced by a Sudanese body double . But has his wife confirmed that this was indeed the case? We checked. Death hoax still false in 2024 Africa Check has rated some claims of his death in 2019 and 2020 as false. There is no evidence that Buhari died while he was president and was replaced by a look-alike. Given the bizarre and widespread nature of the claim, the former first lady's statement that her husband died in 2017 would have been reported by both local and international media. However, no credible local or international media has reported that she has made such statements. The claim has been circulating online since 2017. It is still false in 2024.",

        "doc": "Social grants are vital in South Africa. But the president mistook the number of grants for the number of beneficiaries. By using a lower baseline of people employed in 1994, Ramaphosa claimed more progress than has been delivered, while also exaggerating economic growth since then, as inflation has been a key factor. But he was right that a job creation and support programme has created more than 1.7 million opportunities. In a marked departure from recent years, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's eighth state of the nation address started on time, helped in no small part by a boycott by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters. With some polls showing the African National Congress (ANC) facing the battle of its political life to retain an outright majority in upcoming national elections , Ramaphosa sought to rally voters by drawing on the party's 30-year record in office. To do this, Ramaphosa used the life story of \"democracy's child\" Tintswalo - who the president said was born at the dawn of freedom in 1994. Tintswalo, he said, had benefited from free health care, lived in one of the \"millions of houses\" built to house the poor, and had access to basic water and electricity that her parents did not. She had also been enrolled in a no-fee school where she received free meals, was funded by the state through tertiary education and once working, benefited from employment equity and black economic empowerment policies. But was the president on the money with all his claims of progress? We took a closer look. Note: We will be updating this report as we continue to compare more of the claims with the facts - so be sure to check back with us. Social assistance programmes such as grants aim to alleviate poverty, reduce economic inequality and ensure a minimum standard of living for individuals and families in need. The South African Social Services Agency (Sassa) administers and pays out such social benefits, including pensions and child support grants, to citizens. December 2023 is the last month for which Sassa has published data on the number of grants provided each month. At the end of that month, 13,067,314 child support grants were provided. The child support grant is the largest social grant, and including other grants, Sassa reported that a total of 18,890,995 grants had been paid out to beneficiaries by the end of December. There is one grant that is not included here: the Covid-19 social relief of distress (or SRD) grant that has been paid out to beneficiaries since May 2020. A person can only qualify for this grant if they are not already receiving another form of state support. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers the state of the nation address at City Hall in Cape Town on 8 February 2024. ESA ALEXANDER / POOL / AFP Simon Netshifhefhe, Sassa's senior manager for grants projection, reporting and monitoring, told Africa Check that 7,690,106 SRD grants were paid in March 2023 (the most recently reported data). Combined with the 18,829,716 other grants paid in March 2023 , this means just over 26.5 million grants were paid in that month. But this is only the number of grants paid out. It is not the number of people who received a grant. Ramaphosa mistakes grants for recipients While the SRD grant is an exception, some social grant recipients may receive more than one grant. For example, someone could receive both a child support grant as well as a disability grant. Sassa reported that nearly 19 million grants given in December 2023 went to a total of 11,853,781 beneficiaries. In March, there were 11,744,259 beneficiaries , meaning that a total of just over 19.4 million individuals received a grant in that month. This is a common error that Africa Check has corrected in the past . As a result of this mistake, Ramaphosa overestimates the number of beneficiaries by more than six million people. The Covid-19 social relief of distress (or SRD) grant has been paid out to beneficiaries since May 2020. It pays R350 per month to beneficiaries provided that they do not already receive another form of government assistance. The grant is also overseen by Sassa but is not reported alongside other grants in the agency's regular statistical publications . As reported in the above claim, Simon Netshifhefhe, Sassa's senior manager for grants projection, reporting and monitoring, told Africa Check that 7,690,106 SRD grants had been paid in March 2023, the most recent data reported. A higher number of grants, (8,452,917) were approved that month, but not all were paid. This figure is slightly lower than the \"8.5 million\" beneficiaries given in Sassa's 2022/23 annual report , suggesting that these figures have since been revised. Ramaphosa also made this claim during the ANC's annual January 8th statement on 13 January. At the time, Africa Check rated it as an underestimate as Statistics South Africa's now defunct October Household Survey estimated there 8.9 million people were employed in 1994. While that survey has been criticised for under-representing black respondents, it surveyed 30,000 households , and included the nominally independent black \"homelands\" or Bantustans in national statistics for the first time. By using a lower starting point, Ramaphosa again exaggerated the progress made since 1994. The October Household Survey was conducted annually until 1999, when it was replaced by the Labour Force Survey. According to the latest release from Stats SA, covering July to September 2023, an estimated 16.745 million people were employed. But comparing this figure with historical employment numbers is not straightforward, Dr Neva Makgetla , senior economist at the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies research institute, previously told Africa Check. She explained that while the raw number of employed people has increased, so has the working-age population, from 24.6 million in 1994 to 40.9 million today. A more accurate way of looking at the situation, Makgetla said, was in terms of the ratio of those in employment to the working-age population. The ratio was 41% in 2024, roughly the same as in 1994. The size of a country's economy is often measured by its gross domestic product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year. The World Bank has data on South Africa's GDP going back to 1960. It shows that the country's nominal GDP, which does not take into account inflation over the years, grew 2.6 times from US$153.51 billion in 1994 to $405.27 billion in 2022. (Note: 2023 GDP figures are not yet available.) But it's important to separate real economic growth from inflation. World Bank data based on constant or real GDP (which removes the effect of inflation) shows that the country's economy grew 1.9 times from $187.38 billion in 1994 to $360.71 billion in 2022. The Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) was launched in October 2020 to mitigate the economic damage of the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme provides funding for the creation of new jobs and financial support for jobs and livelihoods that would otherwise have been lost. The most recent update of the programme, published in February 2024, says that it has provided 1,762,749 \"jobs and livelihood opportunities\" since inception. It is not clear how many of these are new jobs, as the PES website does not yet include a breakdown of the recently released update. Kate Philip, programme lead for the PES initiative, told Africa Check that the website was \"about to be updated\" to reflect the latest data.",

But with no website or brand identity and a registration fee to access the loan, they are not to be trusted. The Facebook pages Instant mpesa loans payout and LOANS Kes HELA MPESA hope to convince Kenyan users that they are run by reliable financial institutions. The pages offer instant loans paid directly into M-Pesa accounts. M-Pesa is a mobile financial service by Safaricom , Kenya's largest telecoms company. A typical post on one of the pages reads : \"How much #LOAN do you want? 10,000/=, 15,000/=, 20,000/=, 25,000/=,30,000/=. Message directly on Facebook and Whatsapp.\" The two pages have similarly worded ads, suggesting they may be run by the same person. The posts have been published here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But are the loan offers legit? We checked. Registration fee scam The two pages give no details of any website or app where customers could transact. Instead, they ask users to apply for the loans \"on Facebook and WhatsApp\". This is suspicious for pages that claim to offer financial services. We noticed that each of the pages rely on the same single unbranded graphic to advertise the loans on different dates. Genuine financial institutions tend to have professionally designed graphics that use the company's logo and colours. This helps to identify them as legitimate businesses but this is not the case here. To test our suspicion that the Facebook pages and their offers are inauthentic, we texted each of the pages, as instructed in their ads. We immediately received an automated reply offering us a KSh10,000 loan. But there was a catch. We needed to pay a KSh150 \"fee\" to access the loans. This is usually a ploy to scam users out of money. A reputable lender will not ask you to pay any money before giving you a loan. Most will build the cost of lending into the total amount to be repaid. They also do not offer customers loans for an unprompted amount, without the customer specifying how big a loan they wish to apply for. The pages are fake and their loan offers are a scam.

It is also being claimed that since Ronaldo was sentenced by Iran to a brutal punishment of 99 lashings for hugging the woman, as the Islamic court apparently viewed is act as adultery.Right-Wing propaganda website OpIndia shared a report on X (formerly Twitter) about the above-mentioned video where they claimed that the footballer had been sentenced to 99 lashings by Iran. They later updated their report. AT the time of the filing of this report, the tweet by OpIndia still says \"Iran sentences Cristiano Ronaldo to 99 lashes for committing 'adultery\".

According to a report by the Indian Express from September 21, Cristiano Ronaldo met Fatima Hamami at the Al Nassr team's mission headquarters in Tehran on September 19. Hamami, who is 85 per cent paralysed, made hyperrealistic portraits of the Portuguese footballer with her feet. She is a 'superfan' of the footballer. The meeting was held before a match between Al Nassr and Iran's Persepolis Football Club.The report did not have any mention of Ronaldo facing any sentence due to the meeting or for hugging the artist.We came across another report by Marca, Spain's national daily sports newspaper, from October 13, where the title said: \"Iran fact checks report that Cristiano Ronaldo could receive 99 lashes for adultery\". The report mentioned that Iran's Embassy in Madrid had denied the claim that the footballer hasd been sentenced to any such punishment and confirmed that the viral claim was false.Further, we found a tweet from the official X account of the Iranian Embassy in Spain where they denied the claim of any court ruling against Cristiano Ronaldo in Iran and also highlighted how such news could overshadow the plight of Palestinians who were currently stuck in war-stricken regions. The tweet in Spanish can be translated as: \"We strongly deny the issuance of any court ruling against any international athlete in Iran. It is a matter of concern that the publication of such unfounded news could overshadow crimes against humanity and war crimes against the oppressed Palestinian nation. It should be noted that Cristiano Ronaldo travelled to Iran on September 18 and 19 to play in an official soccer match and was very well received by the people and the authorities. His sincere and humane meeting with Fatemeh Hamami was also praised and admired by both the people and the country's sports authorities.\"Desmentimos rotundamente la emisi\u00f3n de cualquier fallo judicial contra cualquier deportista internacional en Ir\u00e1n.

Many social media users have shared the video claiming that the atrocity was committed by Hamas militants against Israeli soldiers.At the 1:45 mark of the clip, a man can be heard speaking with Arabic texts superimposed on the video translating to, \"Allah hu Akbar! We have taken the revenge of Muslims. If you do not withdraw your soldiers, their fate will be like this. You will get used to this view and you will see them being burned by our hands and you will put your finger in your ears so that you do not hear their screams. If you do not leave the lands of the Islamic State, these lands will be graves for your soldiers. You will regret entering it. What is coming is worse and worse. So wait, we are with you waiting. You have burned Muslims, the Turkish government. You opened the US Incirlik base. From there, American planes launched and bombed the soldiers of the Islamic State. This will be your fate, God willing. As you did to our brothers.\" The killer later pours fuel over the burning bodies of two uniformed men.Former media head and spokesperson of BJP in Delhi Naveen Kumar Jindal has shared the video with the caption,\" See the cruel face of Hamas terrorists This video of inhuman and diabolical actions has been made by the terrorists of Hamas in which two Israeli soldiers were tied with chains, wrapped in gunpowder on their bodies and set on fire and they are dying in agony. But still some traitors are supporting Hamas. It is very important to eliminate Hamas terrorists, we all should support @Israel.\" The tweet has received over 1,24,300 views, 3,174 likes and close to 5,000 retweets. (Archived)Several social media users have shared it on X (formerly Twitter), including user Amitabh Chaudhary (@MithilaWaala), who has been found sharing misinformation on the platform several times in the past.Fact CheckWe first noticed that a black emblem was visible on the top right corner of the video almost throughout, which resembled the ISIS flag. Comparison below:We broke down the viral video into key-frames using Invid software and then reverse-searched one of them on Google. This led us to a 2016 report by Turkish Minute, titled 'ISIL allegedly burns 2 Turkish soldiers to death'.The report, which carries a still from the viral video, states, \"The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) allegedly burned alive two Turkish soldiers who it took hostage three weeks ago in the al-Bab region of northern Syria. Solhaber has identified the soldiers as Fethi \u015eahin and Sefer Ta\u015f. A news agency linked to ISIL said on Nov. 29 that ISIL forces had taken two Turkish soldiers captive in al-Bab. Photos and a video allegedly of the two soldiers were shared online on ISIL accounts late on Thursday.\"Another 2016 report by Alarabiya News, titled 'ISIS video shows Turkish troops 'burned alive', too carries a still from the currently viral clip. It states, \"ISIS militants on Thursday released a video purporting to show two captured Turkish soldiers being burned alive. The video, showing two uniformed men being hauled from a cage before being bound and torched, was posted on militant websites.\" The report further added that \"The 19-minute footage was purportedly shot in the ISIS-declared \"Aleppo Province\" in northern Syria. Speaking in Turkish, the killer of the two men verbally attacks Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and calls for \"destruction to be sowed\" in Turkey.\"The incident was also reported by Al Jazeera, AFP, BBC, and VOA News amongst other media outlets.To sum up, a video depicting two chained soldiers being torched to death went viral on social media with several users claiming that the atrocity was committed by the Hamas militants against the Israeli soldiers amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. However, our fact-check revealed that the video was released by ISIS in 2016 when ISIS terrorists had executed two Turkish soldiers in Syria.Abira Das is an intern at Alt News.Donate to Alt News!Independent journalism that speaks truth to power and is free of corporate and political control is possible only when people start contributing towards the same.

Posted by Lilesh Yadav on Wednesday, 20 September 2023The post also went viral on Twitter.Fact CheckA Google reverse image search led us to a report by News 18, which stated that on the occasion of Vishwakarma Jayanti on September 17, 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Yashobhoomi Convention Centre in Delhi and launched the PM-Vishwakarma scheme, an initiative to encourage artisans and craftsmen and those engaged in work based on traditional skills. \"Ahead of the launch of the PM-Vishwakarma scheme, PM Modi also interacted with Vishwakarma partners at the India International Convention and Expo Centre and appreciated their artefacts. The prime minister at the launch of the scheme said that under the PM Vishwakarma scheme, the government will provide up to Rs 3 lakhs loan without any (bank) guarantee.\", the report added.A key-word search on Google led us to a report published by NDTV, which stated, \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday met several craftsmen at YashoBhoomi convention centre in Delhi on the occasion of Lord Vishwakarma Jayanti. PM Modi also praised \"India's artisanal diversity\" and extended his greetings on the occasion. He met several artists and craftsmen such as potters, tailors, masons, cobblers and more.\" The report contained several images of PM Modi's interaction with the craftsmen, where we can see the image of PM Modi interacting with the potters.A key-word search on YouTube led us to a video report by India Today, titled \"PM Modi Meets Artisans And Craftsmen Related To Footwear Industry At Yashobhoomi Convention Centre\", where at the 0:34 mark, the foot-wear craftsman can be seen conversing with the PM.A closer look at both images reveals that both the men (in white shirts) are not identical and, in fact, are two different persons.To sum up, two pictures are viral on social media, with the claim that the same person is posing as a shoemender and a potter in them. Alt News fact check revealed that the claim is false, as the images are of two different persons.Abira Das is an intern at Alt News.Donate to Alt News!Independent journalism that speaks truth to power and is free of corporate and political control is possible only when people start contributing towards the same.

        "doc": "The story uses only screenshots and not actual tweets to withhold the identity of the children involved.A collage of three photos depicting a shell-shocked girl covered in debris being rescued by three different persons has gone viral on social media. In the first picture, the young girl is being carried by a man wearing a white helmet, in the second picture, she is held by a man in a yellow t-shirt and in the third, by a man wearing a green check shirt and a pair of spectacles. Several social media users shared the picture claiming or indirectly suggesting that the young Palestinian girl and the three rescuers were paid actors in a staged scene since the same girl could not be rescued thrice by three different persons.Though not entirely visible, it is clear that in the first picture, the rescuer is carrying two children in his arms.A verified handle on X (formerly Twitter), Squint Neon (@TheSquind), posted the picture with the caption, \"This Palestinian girl is saved by 3 different people from 3 different locations on 3 different days and all locations are 50 KM apart from each other. Wondering why she keeps travelling so far especially in the conflict zone?\" The tweet has received over 2,37,400 views, 10,000 likes and 3,700 retweets.

(Archives: 1, 2, 3, 4) The post is also viral on Facebook.This slideshow requires JavaScript.Fact CheckFirst, we separately reverse-searched each of the three images on Google. This led us to several 2016 reports by various media outlets that featured the images used in the viral collage. The three images are of the same incident from 2016 when there was an explosion at a funeral gathering in Aleppo, Syria.Image 1:A 2016 report by The Sun, titled, 'DEATH FROM ABOVE Pro-Assad choppers drop cruel barrel bombs on Syrian WAKE held for children killed in Aleppo' featured the first image that depicted the young girl being held by a man wearing a white helmet. The picture was captioned, \"Rescuer carries tots away from collapsed building after devastating attack. Credit: GETTY IMAGES\"The report states, \"Pro-Assad pilots have dropped cruel barrel bombs near where the families of eleven children killed in an earlier attack were grieving. At least 15 civilians were killed in the strike on a part of rebel-held Aleppo in northern Syria.\"Another 2016 report by The Washington Post titled \"Airstrike in east Aleppo hits funeral\" featured a image of the girl and the man in a white helmet with the caption, 'Syrian civilians and a rescue worker evacuate children in eastern Aleppo after regime aircraft reportedly dropped barrel bombs on Aug. 27. (Ameer Alhalbi/AFP/Getty Images). The image shows the rescuer handing over the girl to another man even as he carries a young boy with his right hand.A comparison between the image used by The Washington Post and two of the viral pictures reveals that the white helmet rescuer is the man in the first photo in the viral collage and the man to whom he hands over the girl is the man in the third photo of the viral collage.This slideshow requires JavaScript.Taken together, the photos used in The Sun and The Washington Post clearly establish a chronology. The rescuer in a white helmet was initially carrying two children in his arms. Later, he hands over the girl to the bespectacled man in a green check shirt.Image 2:A 2016 report by NBC News, featured the second image depicting the young girl being held by a man wearing a yellow t-shirt with the photo caption, \"A Syrian man carries a wounded child in eastern Aleppo after Saturday's bombing.AMEER ALHALBI / AFP \u2013 Getty Images.\"Image 3:Another report of the same incident was published by AoI. which featured the third image in the viral collage. The featured image carried the caption, \"SYRIA-CONFLICT, Photo credit: Getty\".Taking a cue from the source cited by the above-mentioned media outlets, we searched the three images on Getty Images which further confirmed that the images were clicked by photo-journalist Ameer Alhalbi in Aleppo, Syria back in 2016. (Images: 1, 2, 3)This slideshow requires JavaScript.When Alt News reached out to Ameer Alhalbi, he shared an AFP video with us, where he explained, \"There was a first bombing and five minutes later, there was a second bombing. I was taking photos and in a situation like this there is more than one building that has been completely destroyed. There are many people who help the White Helmets to get the victims out and sometimes it's complicated. The car has come to take them, these injured people to the hospital, but can not go all the way to meet them. So, there are people who will pass the child to someone, who will pass the child to the next person. Really, it's just the fastest way to help as much as possible.\" White Helmets is a humanitarian organisation in Syria.Alt News also noted that the photo collage was previously viral with other false claims.To sum up, the collage depicting a shell-shocked girl covered in debris being rescued by three different people is not a staged act by Palestinians to deceive the public. Our fact-check revealed that the three images were taken in eastern Aleppo, Syria, on August 27, 2016, one after the other. They show the same girl being passed on from one man to the next to expedite the process of rescue and rehabilitation.The readers should note that the amplification of such images can be seen as part of a larger effort by pro-Israel influencers and social media users to call into question Palestine's claims of the human cost of the war on their side. The official X handles of the state of Israel and its associated offices were previously found trying to pass off footage of a dead 4-year-old child from Gaza as a 'doll'. More recently, Israel mocked a survivor of a July invasion by its forces of a refugee camp in West Bank by calling him an 'actor'. In yet another instance, a Halloween image from Thailand was used by pro-Israel users to claim it was a 'fake war victim' from Gaza pretending to be dead.Abira Das is an intern at Alt News.Donate to Alt News!Independent journalism that speaks truth to power and is free of corporate and political control is possible only when people start contributing towards the same.

        "doc": "The Karnataka School Examination and Assessment Board (KSEAB) released the timetable for preparatory exams for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) on February 2. Several social media users have taken an issue with the timing of the exam scheduled on March 1.  They have objected to the examination being held on March 1 in the second half with the claim that all other exams are to be held in the first half except the one on Friday, March 1, to facilitate Muslim students offering Friday prayers.  Vistara News shared a link to their news report on X (formerly Twitter) on February 4 regarding the exam schedule. The title of the report written in Kannada, when translated, reads: \"SSLC Exam: Muslim favor in exam; Time for Namaz instead!\" (Archive)  Quote-tweeting Vistara News' tweet, BJP Karnataka's official X page claimed that the chief minister Siddaramaiah was doing 'appeasement politics'. The tweet by BJP also mentioned that the Karnataka state administration was being run by the Taliban in an ISIS-like model. The tweet has now been deleted. (Archive)  Chakravarty Sulibele (@astitvam), a premium X subscriber, shared the above-mentioned image of the exam schedule on February 4 with the following caption: \"Karnataka state 10th standard exam time table released. All the exams are in the morning session but for Friday. Why? Oh.. time for Namaz?\" The tweet has received over 2.6 Lakh views and has been retweeted over 1,600 times.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.  Fact Check  On running a relevant keyword search, we came across a tweet by Karnataka Congress's official handle. Quote-tweeting BJP Karnataka's claim, the INC Karnataka responded through a tweet in Kannada which can be translated as: \"On the first day of March, the SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) exam will be conducted in the afternoon due to the commencement of the PUC (Pre-University) exams on the same day. As a result of the absence of the PUC exam on the following days, the SSLC exam will begin in the morning. To avoid the shortage and chaos at exam centers, the following procedure is in place\u2026\"  The tweet also slammed @BJP4Karnataka for \"resorting to misinformation through false propaganda.\" \u0cae\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0c9a\u0ccd \u0c92\u0c82\u0ca6\u0ca8\u0cc7 \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cc0\u0c96\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cc1 \u0caa\u0cbf\u0caf\u0cc1\u0cb8\u0cbf \u0caa\u0cb0\u0cc0\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb7\u0cc6 \u0c86\u0cb0\u0c82\u0cad\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cc1\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0cc1\u0cb5 \u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ca3 \u0c85 \u0ca6\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ca6 SSLC \u0caa\u0cb0\u0cc0\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb7\u0cc6\u0caf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0cc1 \u0cae\u0ca7\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cbe\u0cb9\u0ccd\u0ca8 \u0ca8\u0ca1\u0cc6\u0cb8\u0cb2\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cc1\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cbf\u0ca6\u0cc6.  We also found a statement by Karnataka education minister Madhu Bangarappa where he addressed the claims regarding the exam timing. He reiterated the above logic behind the examination timings and stated that the schedule was prepared keeping in mind what would benefit the students.  Further, we looked into the schedule for the PUC exams that is slated ti begin from March 1. It can be seen that two papers are scheduled on March 1 in the first half. The readers should also note that no examination has been scheduled on March 8 on account of the Hindu religious festival of Mahashivratri. March 1 is the only day when both SSLC and PUC exams are to be held. Hence, the two exams are scheduled for either half.  We also noticed in the PUC exam timetable that exams were scheduled on Friday, March 15 and Friday, March 22, in the first half of the day.  Therefore, the claim that the exam timing for the SSLC preparatory exam on March 1 has been adjusted to suit Muslim students who go for prayer on Fridays is baseless. The schedule has been designed like that to accommodate the PUC exam schedule which begins on the same day.  Donate to Alt News!

In the footage, she is heard telling former Vice-President and then Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari, \"The House is not functioning after 12 PM every day. You are the Chairman of the House, it is your responsibility to ensure it functions in order after 12 PM. Who will be responsible for this? You leave every day at 12 PM and the House stops being functional. Who will make arrangements for it?\"  It has been claimed that Congress-nominated Vice-President Hamid Ansari used to adjourn the Rajya Sabha at 12 PM every day to offer Namaz prayers and all the members of the Parliament used to sit idle waiting for him, due to which the proceedings of the House remained closed.  Retired IAS officer and BJP supporter Surya Pratap Singh made a similar claim while sharing the video.

(@suryapsingh_IAS) February 7, 2024  BJP supporter Jitendra Pratap Singh also amplified the clip, calling Hamid Ansari a terrorist and a 'jihadi' supporter and claimed that the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman used to go to the mosque every day at 12 PM to offer Namaz prayers and deliver sermons, and did not return. He added that Mayawati exposed this behaviour of his. (Archived link)  While promoting the video, Keya Ghosh, Media in-charge of BJP Bengal, and Megh Updates, a Twitter handle that often spreads misinformation online, wrote that Vice-President Hamid Ansari used to leave the Rajya Sabha every day at 12 PM for Namaz prayers. When Mayawati questioned him, he tried to divert the matter.  Fact Check  Hamid Ansari was the Vice-President of India from 2007 to 2017. Since the Vice-President is the chairman of the Rajya Sabha, it is obvious that this video must have been taken between 2007 and 2017. It is worth noting that there is no mention of 'Namaz' anywhere in the viral video by BSP supremo Mayawati. Alt News performed a keyword search using date filters to uncover the full context behind this video. We found an article published in the Economic Times dated December 12, 2012. According to this report, Mayawati was protesting against the repeated disturbances over the bill providing reservations in promotions for SC/ST communities in government jobs. There was a conflict between her party and the Samajwadi Party regarding this issue.  We also found a video uploaded on ABP News' YouTube channel from December 12, 2012 (typo in original article), which contains an excerpt from Mayawati's viral video. The title of this video reads, \"Mayawati stuns Rajya Sabha, questions chairman Hamid Ansari's absence\".  Chronology of incidents  December 11, 2012 According to a Deccan Herald report from December 11, 2012, the bill providing reservations in promotions for SC/ST in government jobs could not be introduced due to opposition from the Samajwadi Party. Though the UPA was in support of this bill, the DMK wanted to include OBCs under the provisions of the bill as well. The BJP had not made its stand clear on this issue, but the Samajwadi Party had disagreements with the BSP regarding this bill. SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav stated, \"The courts have criticized this move, and if the government remains adamant on passing this bill, the courts will again reject it. We will continue to oppose this bill.\" The Samajwadi Party had said that if this bill was introduced then they would disrupt the proceedings of the House daily. The SP also interrupted the proceedings of the House several times over 14 days while this issue was being discussed. Mayawati criticized the BJP for stalling the proceedings of the House and accused the Samajwadi Party of working at the behest of the BJP. She said that if the government's perspective on this issue did not change in the following two to three days, the BSP would have to adopt a tough stance.  December 12, 2012 As per a story published on India TV's website on December 12, 2012, BSP chief Mayawati, during the Rajya Sabha proceedings on the same day, questioned Chairman Hamid Ansari over the frequent disruptions in the House and stated, \"The House is not functioning after 12 PM every day. You are the Chairman of the House, it is your responsibility to ensure it functions in order after 12 PM. Who will be responsible for this?\" According to the report, due to this row, proceedings were delayed in both the Houses for the third consecutive day. Her anger was over the delay in considering the bill providing for reservations in promotions for SC/ST groups in government jobs. While the BSP was pushing for this bill, the Samajwadi Party strongly opposed it arguing that it would divide the society. Due to the chaos in the ongoing tussle over this, this bill could not be presented in the Parliament.  December 13, 2012 A report published on the India Today website on December 13, 2012 stated that then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had called Vice-President Hamid Ansari to express his concern over the incident in the Rajya Sabha. Despite the insults fielded at the VP, the government and Congress had refrained from openly criticizing the BSP leader. Congress spokesperson Renuka Chaudhary had said that the attack on the Rajya Sabha chairman was saddening, but she also said that the issue of reservation for SC/STs in promotions in government jobs affected one of the largest states and the parties concerned should take note of it. They should be given the opportunity to say what they want. The Samajwadi Party said that the move to reserve SC/ST in promotion in government jobs was unconstitutional and it would deprive 80% of employees from availing job promotions. Along with this, MPs from the Samajwadi Party had threatened to disrupt the Rajya Sabha every day if necessary.  December 14, 2012 Hindustan Times reported on December 14, 2012 that Mayawati had told Chairman Hamid Ansari in the Rajya Sabha that she respected him and his position, and was confident that he would find a way to ensure the House ran smoothly and the bill was passed. She said that it was unfortunate that the bill could not be introduced in the last session or current session of Parliament due to the interruptions.  To sum it up, the comments by Mayawati in the viral video are not related to then Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari going to offer Namaz prayers at 12 PM. Neither was Mayawati questioning him on this matter. Several BJP supporters and social media users shared the video of BSP chief Mayawati with false claims.  Donate to Alt News!

However, in 2012, the maximum character limit for a tweet was 140. This suggests that Kejriwal's 'tweet' is not genuine.Amanpreet Singh Uppal, the team lead for AAP Delhi's social media, responded to Bhatia's tweet with a graphic fact-checking the viral claim, urging him to refrain from sharing \"fake tweet\".Fake Tweet \u0914\u0930 \u091c\u0941\u092e\u0932\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u090a\u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0938\u094b\u091a \u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094b \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e\u0908\u092f\u094b pic.twitter.com/9wNAKe8F3O \u2014 Amanpreet Singh Uppal (@iAmanUppal) December 22, 2023We also used Twitter's advanced search feature to look at Kejriwal's tweets on the day of the purported tweet, November 24. None of them are similar to the one seen in the viral screenshot.Hence, it is clear that a fake tweet is being attributed to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the backdrop of the ED summons to him for the third time in the Delhi excise policy case.

Theexecutive orderdoesn\u2019t do any of these things. It urged the Federal Reserve to explore whether the central bank should create its own digital currency and directed the Treasury Department and other federal agencies to study the impact of cryptocurrency on financial stability and national security.THE FACTS: In March, Biden signed Executive Order 14067, titled Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. The long-anticipated executive order called on government agencies to look at the risks and benefits of digital currencies.Five months later, social media users are spreading unsupported theories about what the order will do.\u201cYour paper money will become worthless, it\u2019s going to be replaced with Biden bucks,\u201d read one widely shared Facebook post, which added that \u201cprogrammable digital tokens\u201d would be able to \u201cturn off your account whenever they want\u201d using a social credit score system.\u201cA global \u2018CASHLESS SOCIETY\u2019 is being rolled out, possibly in December 2022,\u201d another post claimed.Some of the online posts directed readers to the fourth section of theexecutive order, which focuses on policy and action related to a potential central bank digital currency, or CBDC.However, the executive order does not create such a system. It directs the Federal Reserve and other agencies to study the risks and benefits of that approach and charges the Attorney General with deciding whether legislative changes would be necessary to implement such a change.Many proponents of digital currencies, more often called cryptocurrencies, prefer a system where the currency is not controlled by any government.\u201cAt this stage, the Fed is just introducing the subject into the public debate and is weighing the options,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. Prasad explains that other countries such as China, Japan and Sweden have already begun tests of digital currencies at their own central banks.However, with this executive order the U.S is weighing its options and paying attention to concerns of potential loss of privacy. \u201cIt is a legitimate concern that, given the traceability of digital transactions, a central bank digital currency could result in the loss of privacy in financial transactions relative to the use of cash,\u201d said Prasad, who is also the author of the book The Future of Money.This claim and other claims that the executive order renders paper money worthless or implements a new social credit score system are false, according to Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\u201cThe executive order did not give the green light to a digital currency, to a CBDC,\u201d Klein said in a phone interview. \u201cIt set in place a structure, it set in place a set of studies, and it elevated the attorney general\u2019s role in the process of deciding whether the Fed has existing legal authority or needs new legal authority.\u201dThe goal of digital currency wouldn\u2019t be to eliminate cash, according to Prasad. It would serve as an alternative payment option that is more accessible, compared to existing digital payment options that usually need to be linked to a bank account or credit card.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

Court documents andvideo footage from the attack on the Capitol make clear that Chansley, who is widely known as the \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d and is one of the most recognizable Jan. 6 rioters, entered the Capitol without permission, was repeatedly asked to leave the building and was not accompanied at all times.THE FACTS: After Fox News host Tucker Carlsonbroadcast Jan. 6 security footagepreviously unseen by the public on his Monday night primetime show, social media users began sharing segments from his program that misrepresented Chansley\u2019s involvement in the riot.\u201cBREAKING: Never before seen video of January 6 shows Jacob Chansley, the QAnon Shaman, being led through the Capitol by police the entire time that he was in the building,\u201d reads a tweet that had received more than 189,000 likes and more than 65,000 shares as of Tuesday.The tweet includes a clip from Carlson\u2019s show in which Chansley can be seen calmly walking around the Capitol with officers in tow. Similar social media posts received hundreds of thousands of additional likes and shares.But the footage in these posts,provided toCarlson byRepublicanHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, leaves out important context about Chansley\u2019s time in the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot.A statementprepared by the Department of Justice, which was signed by Chansley and his attorney, provides a timeline of the rioter\u2019s movement in the Capitol.For example, the statement explains that Chansley entered the Capitol through a broken door as part of a crowd that \u201cwas not lawfully authorized to enter or remain in the building\u201d and that he was one of the first 30 rioters inside. It goes on to note that although officers asked Chansley and others multiple times to leave the Capitol, he did not comply and actively riled up his fellow rioters. The statement describes Chansley\u2019s interactions with officers, but also points out that he \u201centered the Gallery of the Senate alone.\u201dMany of Chansley\u2019s actions on Jan. 6 are documented in video footage from that day.Chansleypleaded guiltyin September 2021 to afelony chargeof obstructing an official proceeding. Hewas sentencedin November 2021 to 41 months in prison for hisguilty plea, as well as 36 months of supervised release and a fine of $2,000 in restitution.Asked about claims that protesters were led through the building, a Capitol Police spokesperson pointed The Associated Press to an HBO documentary about the riot, \u201cFour Hours at the Capitol,\u201d in which an officer describes his encounter with Chansley, including how he asked the rioter and others to leave the Senate wing.Footage from the interaction, which appears in the documentary at the approximately 47:30 mark,was filmedby New Yorker writer Luke Mogelson.\u201cAny chance I can get you guys to leave the Senate wing?\u201d the officer says as Chansley sits in the presiding officer\u2019s chair on the Senate Dais. \u201cI just want to let you guys know, this is like the sacredest place.\u201dA video of Chansley walking into the Capitol through the broken door ispublicly availableonthe websiteof the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger lambasted Carlson\u2019s segment on the Jan. 6 footage in aninternal memoTuesday. The Capitol Police spokesperson confirmed the memo\u2019s authenticity to the AP.\u201cLast night an opinion program aired commentary that was filled with offensive and misleading conclusions about the January 6 attack,\u201d Manger wrote. \u201cThe opinion program never reached out to the Department to provide accurate context. One false allegation is that our officers helped the rioters and acted as \u2018tour guides.\u2019 This is outrageous and false.\u201d___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

Houston policesaid on Mondaythat its investigation has thus far determined that the shooter, Genesse Ivonne Moreno, identified as female despite using multiple aliases, including the name Jeffery \u2014 or Jeffrey \u2014 Escalante. Multiple court records identify Moreno as female, most recentlyin 2022.THE FACTS: Amid the aftermath ofSunday\u2019s shootingat Lakewood Church, which is led bytelevangelist pastor Joel Osteen, social media users spread false claims about Moreno\u2019s gender identity.\u201cBREAKING: Lakewood Church shooter identified as transgender, legal name Genesse Moreno but went by the name \u2018Jeffrey,\u2019\u201d reads one post on X, formerly Twitter, that had received approximately 9,100 likes and 6,100 shares as of Tuesday.READ MORETucker Carlson was not put on a \u2018kill list\u2019 in Ukraine for Putin interviewNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn\u2019t happen this weekPosts misrepresent the status of a bill that could disqualify Trump from the ballot in HawaiiOthers claimed that Moreno, who was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire, had been born as Jeffery, but went by Genesse as part of her transition.Officials have not found any evidence that Moreno was transgender. Police said she used male and female aliases, but that investigators who looked at past police reports determined she identified as female.\u201cWe do have reports she used multiple aliases, including Jeffery Escalante,\u201d Houston Police Commander Chris Hassig said about 19 minutes into apress conferenceon Monday. \u201cSo she has utilized both male and female names, but through all of our investigation to this point, talking with individuals, interviews, documents, Houston Police Department reports, she has been identified this entire time as female, she, her. And so we are identifying her as Genesse Moreno, Hispanic female.Records in Harris County, where Houston is located, show that Moreno, under the names Jeffery G. Escalante-Moreno or Jeffery G. Escalante, was charged in six criminal cases from 2005 to 2011. She is identifiedasfemaleinallofthem. A case filed in nearby Katy County after Moreno\u2019s latest arrest in April 2022also listsher as female, but with the name Genesse Ivonne Moreno.William Capasso, an attorney in Houston who represented Moreno for a portion of herdivorce proceedingsin 2021 to 2022, told The Associated Press that she went by Jeffrey Moreno-Carranza at the time. He said Carranza was her married name and noted that at that time \u201cthere was no indication that she was transgender.\u201d\u201cIt is my understanding that although her birth name was Jeffrey Moreno, she was born female and identified as a female,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cShe did use Genesse and may have changed her name to Genesse Moreno after I represented her.\u201dCapasso added that Moreno used the name \u201cJeffrey Genesse Escalante Moreno\u201d on her son\u2019s birth certificate. He said he withdrew as Moreno\u2019s attorney in the proceedings because he was not able to communicate with her effectively.Many social media posts used claims about Moreno\u2019s gender identity to advance abaseless narrativethat there has been a rise in transgender or nonbinary mass shooters in recent years. This narrative previously spread widely in March 2023, after an assailant who identified as transgenderkilled six peopleat a Nashville private school.Gender and criminology expertstold The Associated Pressat the time that mass casualty shootings perpetrated by someone identifying as transgender or nonbinary are rare and that those groups are far more likely to be the victims of violence.Authorities said on Monday that Moreno used a legally purchased AR-15 style rifle tocarry out the attackat Lakewood Church, one of the biggest megachurches in the U.S. She was shot and killed by two off-duty officers working security at the building. Two other people were shot and wounded, including Moreno\u2019s young son, who she brought with her to the church.___This is part of the AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

Roosevelt in 1942, authorizing the forced removal from the West Coast of anyone deemed a threat to national security. It paved the way for the relocation and incarceration ofapproximately 120,000 peopleof Japanese ancestry, including U.S.-born citizens, during World War II. The order wasformally terminatedin 1976 by President Gerald Ford. Immigration experts previously told The Associated Press that people who enter the U.S. illegally arenot eligible for federal cash assistance, with exceptions for certain Cubans and Haitians. None of these benefits include a one-time payment of $5,000.THE FACTS: On the 82nd anniversary ofthe orderon Monday, social media users erroneously claimed that it is a recent directive meant to aid those who cross the U.S. border illegally.\u201cBiden\u2019s Executive Order 9066 gives illegals a $5,000 VISA card to use as they wish,\u201d reads one post on X. \u201cIs Biden buying votes?\u201d It had received approximately 12,300 likes and shares as of Tuesday.READ MORENOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn\u2019t happen this weekPosts share erroneous information about suspect identification in Kansas City mass shootingThe Texas megachurch shooter has not been identified as transgender, despite claims onlineAnother X post with more than 11,700 likes and shares falsely states: \u201cExecutive order 9066 is rewarding these illegals with $5,000 gift cards. I\u2019m busting my ass just to get more in debt every month because of Bidenomics. The Democrats have let me know I am DEAD LAST as an American. I will never support a Democrat or liberal after seeing what destruction they have caused in the last 3 years. What about you?\u201dSome posts making these allegations included a video posted to X in December byPinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Arizona. In the video, Lamb falsely claims that in addition to $5,000 Visa gift cards, the government also gives people who enter the U.S. illegally a cell phone and a domestic plane ticket to a location of their choosing. The government does not provide such assistance.But Executive Order 9066 is entirely unrelated to modern-day immigration.Rooseveltsigned the orderon Feb. 19, 1942, shortly after Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor that led the U.S. to formally enter World War II. It allowed anyone deemed a national security threat to beforcibly removedfrom the country\u2019s West Coast, resulting in the relocation and incarceration of roughly 120,000 Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans in desolate camps. The government claimed those heldmight plot against the U.S.during the war even though thousands of them were elderly, disabled, children or infants. Two-thirds were citizens.Theseincarcerations endedfollowing the conclusion of World War II in 1945. President Gerald Fordformally terminatedExecutive Order 9066 on Feb. 19, 1976, its 34th anniversary. A1988 lawprovided remaining survivors of the camps with $20,000 each in restitution, as well as a formal apology.People who enter the U.S. illegallydo not receive$5,000 gift cards from the federal government andare not eligiblefor any federal cash assistance, with exceptions for certainCubans and Haitians, immigration experts previously told the AP. None of these benefits include a one-time payment of $5,000.The AP has also previously reported, contrary to Lamb\u2019s claims, that some people who come to the U.S. illegally may receive phones, but they can only access a monitoring service as part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Alternatives to Detention program. And although limited federal aid can help get migrants where they intend to go, they typically must choose from a set list of destinations and are usually transported by bus, not planes. Lamb has not responded to multiple requests for comment.___This is part of the AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

The spokesperson and a representative of the police union said they did not know what the video showed and when and where it was taken.THE FACTS: As men charged inthe attackwere released without bail this week, social media users falsely claimed that a video showed the NYPD protesting against the decision.The video, which was filmed from a vantage point several stories abovethe cornerof Eighth Avenue and West 56th Street, shows a long line of vehicles with flashing lights driving down Eighth Avenue, sirens blaring.READ MOREVideo from 2022 misrepresented to make southern border convoy look larger than it isNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn\u2019t happen this weekThe WEF\u2019s chairman did not confess that a \u2018political revolution\u2019 is destroying his agenda\u201cI just got a confirmation this is indeed an NYPD protest because the people who attacked the NYPD officers were released without bail,\u201d reads one post on TikTok that shared the video. As of Friday, it had been viewed approximately 2.4 million times.A similar video of the incident, posted earlier in the day by the same user, said the events occurred on Wednesday at 7:35 p.m. and asked, \u201cAnyone know what\u2019s going on in NYC?\u201dA post on X, formerly Twitter, that made a nearly identical claim as the second TikTok post states: \u201cThis should be HEADLINE NEWS on EVERY News Station but it\u2019s not cus it doesn\u2019t fit the liberal agenda! #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica.\u201d It had received approximately 50,000 likes and 20,500 shares.But the NYPD confirmed to the AP in an email that the agency did not stage such a protest. The NYPD could not confirm what the video actually depicts, butpointed to coverageby local news station WABC about a police crackdown on illegal electric mopeds that occurred the same night amid a search for suspects in the case.John Nuthall, a spokesperson for the Police Benevolent Association, which represents NYPD officers, said he was unfamiliar with the video and could not say what it showed.\u201cBut New York City police officers have been showing our solidarity and outrage in other ways,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cYesterday we packed a Manhattan courtroom for the arraignment of another perpetrator of this vicious assault.

A shot approximately 59 seconds in shows a long line of vehicles, sirens blaring, driving down Eighth Avenue. It was filmed at street level near the corner ofWest 45th Street. The scene is similar to the one shown in the video spreading online, which was taken 11 blocks away.A group of individuals attacked two NYPD officers on Saturday in Times Square, as seen insurveillance videoof the incident. The NYPD told the AP on Friday that seven people had been arrested in the case.According to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, charges, including assault and disorderly conduct, were filed against six of them. Five of those charged were released without bail and one was held on $15,000 cash bail. One of the seven was not charged because of insufficient evidence.Six additional suspects are being sought.Their legal status in the U.S. is unknown, NYPD officials said, but they are all considered migrants.NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell called the individuals who attacked the officers \u201creprehensible cowards\u201d at apress conferencethis week.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

The person who took this photograph confirmed it was captured in Oklahoma City before news of theNashville shootingwas widespread. It does not show the shooter.THE FACTS: The photo circulated widely online after the police chief identified the shooter as transgender in a late afternoon news conference on Monday. Police had previously identified the shooter as female.\u201cThis is the trans shooter, Audrey Hale,\u201d read one tweet shared thousands of times. \u201cThe Feds are in the middle of trying to scrub ALL of her social media & pictures from the internet.\u201dThe tweet claimed the shooter was a \u201cterrorist\u201d who wanted to kill Christians, \u201cas the sign makes clear.\u201dHowever, the person holding the sign in the image is not the shooter whoopened fire at The Covenant School, killingthree students and three adults.The woman who took the photo confirmed to The Associated Press that she captured itabout11 a.m. CDT on Monday at a protest and march in downtown Oklahoma City, hundreds of miles away from Nashville.\u201cIt was a protest entitled Bigotry is Bad for Business,\u201d said Chelsea, the photographer, whose last name is being withheld over concerns for her safety. \u201cThey protested, they marched. They weren\u2019t violent.\u201dPolice received a call about an active shooter at the Presbyterian schoolabout10:15 a.m. CDT Monday. They fatally struck Hale about 10:27 a.m., police said.The photographer said she didn\u2019t know the shooting had happened when she tweeted photos from the protest. Social media users then took her photo and misrepresented it as showing the shooter.\u201cAll night long I\u2019ve been trying to explain to people that this is a stunt people are pulling,\u201d she said. \u201cThat person absolutely is not the shooter.\u201dInformation on the shooter\u2019s gender remained unclear Tuesday. For hours Monday, police identified the shooter as a 28-year-old woman and eventually as Audrey Hale. Then at a late afternoon press conference, the police chief said that Hale was transgender. After the news conference, police spokesperson Don Aaron declined to elaborate on how Hale identified.Hale, who was aformer student of the school, had a map of the school with a planned route for the shooting, and officers found writings, police said.No motive has been confirmed by police.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

The posts are misleading: health experts say some of the purported remedies have not been proven to be effective. The list was shared here on Facebook on May 28, 2021. Also Read: Guest On Steve Bannon's Show Falsely Claims Pandemic Was Staged By Philanthropists The post's Korean-language caption translates to English as: \"I see many struggling for one to three days after COVID-19 vaccination. Once you have your vaccination dates arranged, the following tips could help you minimise side effects.\" Screenshot of the misleading Facebook post, taken on June 9, 2021. The lengthy post lists six purported tips for preventing or minimising side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccination: taking antihistamines before getting a Covid-19 jab taking only acetaminophen and avoiding other pain relievers such as aspirin and ibuprofen after vaccination walking and getting more sunlight consuming vitamins C and D taking a deep sleep staying hydrated The misleading posts attribute the tips to \"Rhee Joon-won\", who is listed as a US-based medical specialist on his YouTube channel. He gave a similar list of purported tips in this YouTube video. He did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. A similar list of purported remedies has also been shared in Facebook posts here, here and here. The posts, however, are misleading. Whilst some of the tips are not harmful, most of them have not been proven to reduce COVID-19 vaccination side effects, health experts say. Also Read: Dr Sherri Tenpenny Repeats COVID-19 Misinfo In Ohio State Testimony Antihistamines Antihistamines are medicines used to relieve the symptoms of allergies. They do not prevent side effects of COVID-19 vaccination, according to health experts. \"Antihistamines are designed to mitigate certain allergic reactions, not to prevent them,\" a spokesman for the Korean Pharmaceutical Association (KPA) told AFP on June 9, 2021. Antihistamines also do not prevent rare severe allergic reactions from vaccines, or anaphylaxis, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an advisory published here on March 3, 2021. Pain relievers Contrary to the claim in the misleading posts, health authorities advise that taking acetaminophen, aspirin or ibuprofen can help relieve pain following COVID-19 vaccination. \"We recommend taking acetaminophen, but if you can't find them, ibuprofen or aspirin also could be used,\" the Korean Medical Association advised here on June 7, 2021. The Korean Pharmaceutical Association issued the same advice here on June 7, 2021. Exercise and sunlight There is no credible evidence that walking exercises and getting sunlight prevent or minimise COVID-19 vaccination side effects, according to a spokesman at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). \"KDCA rather advises against heavy exercise before receiving a COVID-19 jab as it is important to feel best on the day of the vaccination,\" the spokesman told AFP on June 14, 2021. Also Read: Fake Graphic Claims 10,000 Deaths Caused By COVID-19 Vaccines in Europe Vitamin supplements There is also no clear evidence that vitamin supplements prevent vaccination side effects, experts say. \"Vitamins are known to counteract oxidative stress, but it is not clear if antioxidants, such as vitamins, can prevent side effects of COVID-19 vaccines,\" Yum Ho-kee, a professor at Inje University Paik Hospital's Department of Internal Medicine told AFP on June 9, 2021. 'Deep sleep' Sleep improves general health but there is no evidence it prevents vaccination side effects either, Yum said. \"The best way to recover from COVID-19 vaccination side effects is taking sufficient rest after the vaccination,\" he said. Staying hydrated The CDC advises here on May 25, 2021 drinking \"plenty of fluids\" to reduce discomfort from any fever that might arise post-vaccination. Vaccine side effects Also Read: COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not Make The Human Body Bluetooth Compatible Side effects after COVID-19 vaccination are \"normal and not a cause for alarm, \" according to a statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) published here on March 31, 2021.

        "doc": " A video advertisement on Facebook encourages people to buy face masks for protection, as the novel coronavirus takes a deadly toll worldwide. The clip is misleading; it claims to show a family devastated by infection, as well as the doctor who invented the mask it is trying to sell, but the images are stock footage. \"Do It Now or Never!\" says text under the video, which was posted on April 5, 2020 and urges people to buy \"FilterMax\" face masks. The clip -- which refers to \"the fatal pandemic\" and the shortage of masks it has caused, does not name the novel coronavirus -- but tells the alleged story of Justin, the \"youngest son from a family of five\" who it claims is the \"sole survivor from a deadly tragedy.\" A screenshot taken on April 14, 2020 shows a video advertising a face mask The video says Justin's family ignored warnings to stay indoors -- issued by governments and health authorities during the ongoing novel coronavirus crisis -- and went to a church event, where they were infected and died. Justin, it says, wore one of the masks and lived.

AFP conducted reverse image searches of screenshots from the clip, which revealed that the videos and photos of key people shown in the clip were taken from stock image websites. The family seen at the beginning of the video can be found here and here. Screenshots taken on April 14, 2020 show a family allegedly devastated by an infection (L) and the same people in a stock video (R) The footage of the boy in the clip comes from this stock video. Screenshots taken on April 14, 2020 show a boy said to be the sole survivor from his family of five (L) and the same boy in a stock video (R) \"Dr Hiroshi,\" described in the video as the \"Infectious Disease specialist\" who created the mask, is actually two different models from stock image sites here and here. Screenshots taken on April 14, 2020 show a man said to be the inventor of a face mask (L) and the same man in a stock photo (R) Screenshots taken on April 14, 2020 show a different man who is also said to be the inventor of the same face mask (L) and the same man in a stock photo (R) The same story has been used before to advertise \"FilterMax\" face masks on Facebook, but with different images. Another version of the misleading ad, now removed from Facebook, used a photo of a family taken during a professional photoshoot. After seeing the video pop up in her feed, one family member reported it to the platform, according to a local TV report. A screenshot taken on April 10, 2020 shows another video advertising the same face mask, which has since been removed from Facebook Footage of the boy in that version of the clip came from a video about a teenager with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, while it used footage of Nobel laureate Yoshinori Ohsumi to represent the inventor of the mask. ALSO READ: Video Of Black Friday Sale Shared As Panic Buying In Malaysia Lockdown The misleading ads, which play heavily on fears with dramatic music in the background, have been viewed more than 1.1 million times on Facebook. Although advertising the same product, the videos linked to different sites where they could be bought -- here and here -- both of which are now unavailable. A screenshot of a website selling FilterMax masks taken on April 10, 2020 And while the videos claim the boy's life was saved because he wore a mask, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus to others, not to keep the wearer from becoming infected.

This is misleading; Bourla's full remarks in a recent interview make clear he was speaking about the efficacy of two doses against the Omicron variant, not Covid-19 in general. \"After once claiming his shots are '100 effective,' Pfizer CEO now says 2 COVID shots 'offer very limited protection, if any,' protection against COVID-19,\" says a January 10, 2022 tweet that refers to quotes from Bourla's interview with Yahoo Finance. Screenshot of a tweet taken on January 14, 2022 The claim -- part of a flood of inaccurate information circulating online about Covid-19 and vaccines -- was repeated in online articles here and here and on Twitter here, here and here. The Omicron variant has caused a surge in Covid-19 cases around the world, with the World Health Organization saying half of Europe is projected to contract it, and that preliminary data points to reduced vaccine effectiveness against it. The full interview with Yahoo Finance, posted online with a transcript, makes clear that Bourla was speaking about the limitations of two doses of the original vaccine against Omicron. \"Here the situation has been deteriorated because of the Omicron, which had a very quick ramp-up. It is a disease that manifests a little bit less in terms of mildness. I mean, it's more mild. But, you know, because of the higher infectious rates, still, the hospitals, in absolute numbers, are going much higher in terms of severe disease, ICUs' occupation, et cetera, et cetera,\" Bourla said. \"We know that the two doses of the vaccine offer very limited protection, if any. The three doses, with the booster, they offer reasonable protection against hospitalization and deaths -- and, again, that's, I think, very good -- and less protection against the infection,\" he added. CNBC reported similar remarks from the CEO that were likewise specific to the Omicron variant. \"The two doses, they're not enough for Omicron,\" Bourla said, adding: \"The third dose of the current vaccine is providing quite good protection against deaths, and decent protection against hospitalizations.\" AFP Fact Check also debunked misleading claims about vaccine efficacy that were sparked by edited footage of an ABC News interview of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky.

        "doc": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his tenth COVID-19 address to the nation, claimed that India has given the world two \"Made in India\" vaccines. This claim is misleading. While Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was researched, indigenously produced and falls under the \"Make In India\" initiative endorsed by the Prime Minister, Covishield- the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is only being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India as part of a technology transfer deal with the vaccine's UK-based inventors. At the 8:30 minute mark, PM Modi can be heard saying, \"Disregarding all the aspersions of whether India could tackle this pandemic, within a year, India launched not only one, but two 'made in India' vaccines.\" The technology, science, research for Covishield were all put in place by scientists at the Jenner Institute of Oxford University who later collaborated with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca, then signed contracts with other vaccine manufacturers to further accelerate the distribution of this vaccine across the world. Pune's Serum Institute of India, renowned for its ability to manufacture large quantities of vaccines, was just one of them. AZ has also signed similar deals with Emergent Biosolutions in US, SK Bioscience in South Korea, and Siam Bioscience in Thailand. SII has been manufacturing vaccines since 1966. One of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers, the biotechnology company has globally sold more than 1.5 billion vaccine doses which includes vaccines for polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib, BCG, r-Hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella. Covishield, as SII decided to name the vaccine, was one of the two vaccines along with Covaxin that were given emergency use authorization in January 2021. Currently, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, the drug regulator in India, has even approved Sputnik V and its arrival in the Indian markets to be purchased by the Centre and private hospitals. Covaxin was produced by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. NIV helped Bharat Biotech with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. Along with Covaxin, India has four other indigenous vaccines at various stages of clinical trials - one by Zydus Cadila using plasmid DNA as a vector, one by Bharat Biotech that is trying an intra-nasal vaccine, one by Biological-E that is using an antigen, and one by Gennova Pharmaceuticals who are using the mRNA technology. Dr. V K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, and Chairman of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19, has been repeatedly stating that the Indian government has been talking to international vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson for distributing their vaccines in India. SII is also going to manufacture the vaccine made by US based Novavax. SII-AZ Vaccine Distribution Agreement SII signed its deal with AstraZeneca to license one billion doses in June 2020. This deal also included close to 20 million doses that SII would contribute to the COVAX agreement that was formed to ensure that all countries across the world have access to the COVID-19 vaccine. All the doses that Serum Institute of India sent under the COVAX agreement were a part of its pre-existing deal. When India granted approval for Emergency Use Authorization to SII, it was manufacturing the doses on the funding they had received when they signed the deal with AstraZeneca, and another $150 million which they received from GAVI and Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation When Did India Fund SII? In an interview in September last year, Adar Poonawalla, Chairman of SII asked if India had Rs 80,000 crores to fund coronavirus vaccine so that it could be accessible for everybody in the country. He asked this question pertaining to procurement of the vaccines but not for the development of new vaccines. Till April 19, 2021, the Indian government was only paying SII for the doses it had purchased. As reports of shortage of the vaccine rose, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman then announced the government's decision to fund the research and development of both Covishield and Covaxin so that their production capacities could be ramped up. SII got close to Rs 3000 cr but only after Poonawalla pleaded for the government to intervene as he wanted to raise SII's production capacity after a fire at the company's Pune facility in January slowed their production process. Other Vaccination Statements By PM Modi With other foreign as well as indigenous vaccines in the pipeline, the government has also decided to bring about yet another change to the nation's vaccine procurement process. After the Supreme Court reprimanded the Centre as well as several states complained that international manufacturers wanted to only deal with the Central government, the Modi government has decided to modify the vaccine policy. The Centre will now take onus for even vaccinating people belonging to 18-44 age group. The state governments will now not be involved in the vaccine procurement process. The Centre will procure 75 per cent of the manufactured vaccines while the remaining 25 per cent will be procured by private hospitals. Furthermore, PM Modi announced a cap on the money private hospitals could charge as service charge after there were reports of hospitals charging exorbitant and arbitrary charges. The hospitals can only charge \u20b9150 as service charge after procuring Covishield at \u20b9600 and Covaxin at \u20b91200. ",

On March 18, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the jab is \"safe and effective\" and not associated with a higher blood clot risk after days of commotion around the shot.

The image was also shared in Facebook posts here, here, and here alongside a similar claim. The claim is misleading. Greek origins Before the coronavirus pandemic, AstraZeneca explained the origins of its name in a series of tweets on October 17, 2019. \"Astra\" derives from the Greek word \"astron\", meaning \"star\". \"Zeneca\" is the name of a former British pharmaceutical company and does not have another meaning in any language, according to AstraZeneca's tweet. \"Zeneca\" is an invented name, created by an agency instructed to find a name which began with a letter from either the top or bottom of the alphabet and was phonetically memorable, of no more than three syllables and did not have an offensive meaning in any language. \u2014 AstraZeneca (@AstraZeneca) October 17, 2019 In 1999, Astra AB and Zeneca Group merged to form AstraZeneca in one of the largest ever European mergers, as noted in reports at the time by BBC and CNN. The former chief executive of Zeneca, David Barnes, told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph in January 2001 that he instructed branding agency Interbrand to find a name. Also Read: No, COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not Invalidate Life Insurance Policies \"There is an advantage in being alphabetically at the top or bottom of lists, A or Z,\" Barnes told The Daily Telegraph. \"I asked Interbrand to find a name that was phonetically memorable, of no more than three syllables and didn't mean anything stupid, funny or rude in other languages. A new name also allowed us to instill a new company culture\". (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by BOOM staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The post, archived here, has been liked 200 times since it was published on Instagram on June 4, 2021. Also Read: John McAfee's Doctored Tweet Misleadingly Linked To Miami Condo Collapse It claims to show an excerpt from the book \"The Future of Life\", allegedly written by Attali. \"The future will be about finding a way to reduce population,\" the alleged quote begins. Screenshot of the false Instagram post, taken on June 23, 2021 \"We will find a cause (...) a pandemic (...) a virus affecting the old and fat,\" it continues. Attali, a former adviser to late French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, has written numerous books. However, none of them were called \"The Future of Life\". Also Read: No, Moderna Did Not Develop A COVID-19 Vaccine Before The Pandemic \"Future Life\", published in 1981 in French as \"L'Avenir du Futur\" and later translated into English, was written by Michel Salomon and features an interview with Attali in which he answers the question \"Is it possible and desirable to live 120 years?\" The book's publisher, Seghers, sent AFP a copy of the passage in which Attali is quoted. Excerpt featuring Attali's interview in the original French version of \"Future Life\" At one point in the interview, Attali says: \"...as soon as a person gets to be older than sixty or sixty-five, and his productivity and profitability begin to slip, he costs society dearly.\" And later: \"Actually, from the viewpoint of the cost to society, it is much preferable that the human machine abruptly stop functioning than that it deteriorate very gradually.\" However, Attali never mentions depopulating the planet as claimed by the false Facebook post. A longer version of the same claim circulated in French, which AFP Fact Check debunked here. Also Read: No, Profusa's Biosensors Are Not Inserted Into Humans Via COVID-19 Vaccines \"This text is completely made up... It is in no way close to the initial excerpt. It is like saying that I wrote 'Mein Kampf'\", Attali told AFP Fact Check on April 12, 2021. AFP Fact Check has previously debunked two other false quotes attributed to Attali about media conspiracies and COVID-19 (in French).

        "doc": "A disturbing video from 2016 of two Turkish soldiers being burnt alive by the terrorist group Islamic State (IS) is being shared with the false claim that it shows the torture being meted out to Israeli soldiers by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.On October 7, Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls the Gaza strip, launched a surprise attack on border towns and villages of Israel killing over 1400 Israelis and taking nearly 200 as hostages. Israel has retaliated with relentless airstrikes on Gaza. According to officials quoted in reports, more than 4,137 Palestinians including children in Gaza have been killed since the conflict started.The conflict has also led to a deluge of mis and disinformation on social media platforms especially X (formerly Twitter) with several Indian verified accounts sharing anti Palestine and pro Israel misinformation. BOOM has debunked several such fake and false posts being shared on social media since the conflict began.Read factchecks about the Israel- Palestine conflict on BOOM's WhatsApp Channel hereThe disturbing video shows two soldiers standing, tied to the two ends of a metal chain and then the chain set on fire, spreading to the soldiers eventually kiling them. The video also has music overlaid on it and has a slick production quality that are a feature of Islamic State's propaganda videos that show horrific violence and human rights violations.The video is being shared with a text in Hindi which roughly translates to, \"See the cruel face of Hamas terrorists. This video of inhuman and diabolical action is by the terrorists of Hamas in which two Israeli soldiers were tied with chains, wrapped in gunpowder on their bodies, set on fire and they are dying in agony. But still some traitors are supporting Hamas. It is very important to eliminate Hamas terrorists, we all should support @Israel.\"The video is also being shared on WhatsApp with an English text, \"Hamas barbarians burning chained Israeli soldiers alive\"Given the disturbing nature of the video, BOOM is not not including the same in the story.Former Bharatiya Janata Party Delhi wing spokesperson Naveen Kr Jindal shared the video on the X (formerly Twitter)View an archive of the post hereFACT CHECKWe noticed the ISIS black and white flag with Arabic text visible on the left corner of the video and a reverse image search using keywords \"IS burns soldier\" showed news results from 2016 of two likely Turkish soldiers burnt by the terrorist organisation in Syria.According to a BBC report dated December 23, 2016, \"...lslamic State (IS) has released a video online which claims to show two captured Turkish soldiers being burned alive. IS said they were killed in revenge for Turkish killing of Muslims. Turkey launched a campaign against IS in northern Syria in August and is currently fighting IS around the group's stronghold of al-Bab.\"A Reuters report from the same day quoted a US based SITE Intelligence Group and said, \"Islamic State in Syria released a video on Thursday purporting to show two captured Turkish soldiers being burned to death, according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group which monitors militant groups online.\" It further added, \"Late last month, Turkish military officials said they had lost contact with two soldiers in northern Syria, where the army is waging an offensive against Islamic State.\"Al Jazeera reported that in the video, the men carrying weapons who kill the soldiers, are speaking in Turkish and \"criticise Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\" and further \"call for destruction to be sowed in Turkey.\"News site Al Arabiya also reported the story with visuals from the video.We then ran a search for Turkish media outlets which had reported on the incident and found a report by 'Turkish Minute' which quoting a local news outlet reported that the soldiers had been identified as \"Fethi \u015eahin and Sefer Ta\u015f.\"The report also carried a screenshot from the video which matches the viral video.",

One of the comments under a video shared by @magicalmagicworld suggested how the video was digitally altered to replace a human with the robot.Taking a clue from this, we then ran a reverse image search of visuals from the video that did not include the robot but just the two opponents and found a video shared on Facebook on October 21, 2021 by a page called 'Phalore bedmation club'The video was an exact match to our viral video with one exception-- it showed a grown man in a black t-shirt competing with two opponents.Here is a comparison between the viral video and the original video.BOOM could not independently verify when the CGI video was first shared or who created it.",

This was followed by Canada and India expelling diplomats from either side in a tit-for-tat move. India suspended visa services for Canadian citizens, deepening the rift. Meanwhile, Canada's Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre urged the prime minister to \"come clean with facts' on allegations of India's role in the murder of the pro-Khalistan leader.X hande Norbert Elikes (@NorbertElikes) posted the viral video with the caption, \" News: In the Canadian Parliament, Opposition Leader Scheer takes aim at @JustinTrudeau over the diplomatic row with India: \"Do you have any evidence for your conspiracy theories?

Tory Leader Andrew Scheer is accusing Trudeau of \"incompetence\" over the incident. (Feb. 28, 2018)\"Trudeau was grilled by opposition Canadian MPs over invitations issued to Jaspal Atwal, a Sikh convicted of attempting to assassinate an Indian cabinet minister in 1986. Atwal attended two events with Trudeau in India during the latter's visit to the country in February 2018.The controversy broke out after Trudeau returned to Canada from his India visit after reports in the Canadian press sourced to an unidentified Canadian official had suggested factions within the Indian government were allegedly involved in sabotaging Trudeau's visit to India.The Indian government had then issued a statement calling the allegations \"baseless and unacceptable.\" Trudeau accepted the offer of Liberal Party MP Randeep Sarai to resign as chair of the party's Pacific caucus after he had taken responsibility for inviting an Atwal to events with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India.",

The video was titled 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicates 'Yashobhoomi' Convention Centre to Nation in Delhi'.A clear visual of the cobbler can be seen at the 19:00 mark and the potter at the 19:13 mark.We also found a Facebook video uploaded on the official page of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) on September 18 that carried a byte of the cobbler. At the 0:01 mark of the video, he mentions that his name is Machendra Gangaram Kamble, and he hails from Belgaum, Karnataka.We also found a Facebook post by Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India, Ahmedabad on September 20. While sharing a photo showing all the potters, the post mentioned how PM Modi was interacting with Baijnath Prajapati (seen in the yellow kurta) during the launch of the scheme.Click here to view.We then contacted Baijnath Prajapati, who revealed that the man beside him was Surendra Prajapati, who was helping him and the woman seen in the photo.BOOM also reached out to Surendra Prajapati who confirmed that it was him in the visuals along with the other potters and that he was helping make the mud for the potters. \"If you see us face to face, there is no resemblance in our features,\" he added.Below is a comparison between the cobbler Machendra Kamble and potter Surendra Prajapati's faces:",

The post is viral in this backdrop.An X (formerly Twitter) user Monika Langeh shared the video with the caption, \"These perpetrators Sehbaz,Arbaz and Faisal pulled the dupatta of a girl who was riding on her bicycle,she fell off and got run over by another bike ..eventually died on the spot.

Visuals of thousands of empty seats were seen at the Narendra Modi stadium which has a capacity of around 1,32,000, during the game.

Hailing from Vizag, Andhra Pradesh, Yarraji is a national record holder in the women's 100 m hurdle category. She is expected to begin competing at the Asian Games from September 30 onward, participating in the women's 200m and women's 100m hurdles.The 2-minute long video was shared by singer Asha Bhosle's official X (formerly Twitter) account with the caption, \"Heartiest congratulations to Yaraaji from Andhra Pradesh for winning the Gold for 100mts hurdles at the Asian Games.\"Click here to view the post and here for an archive.Click here to view the post and here for an archive.BOOM also received the same claim on our WhatsApp Helpine (7700906111).FACT CHECKBOOM found that the video is from July 13, 2023, when Yarraji won the gold medal at the Asian Athletics Championships and is unrelated to the ongoing Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.We looked at the video closely and found a banner in the background on the 1:32 mark reading 'Asian Athletics Championships 2023'. The Indian flag has been placed on the top right of this video to conceal the logo of the Asian Athletics Championships.Below is a comparison between the logos of the Asian Athletics Championships and the Asian Games.The Asian Athletics Championship was a five day event in July that included events related only to athletics such as javelin throw, hurdle races, long jump, shot put, and relays. The Asian Games, on the other hand, are two weeks long and include events related to athletics as well as other sports such as swimming, shooting, cricket, etc. India clinched its first gold at the Asian Games after Rudranksh Patil, Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, and Divyansh Panwar won the men's 10 m rifle team event.We also found a post from the Reliance Foundation Youth Sports' official Instagram account that congratulated Yarraji for her win. The post was uploaded on July 13 and was also shared on Yarraji's account.The caption mentions that the video is from the official YouTube channel of the Asian Athletics Championships.The official website of the Asian Athletics Championships also shared the participants' individual scores and ranking during the women's 100 m final.Click here to view.We also looked up the Asian Games' official website and found that competitions under athletics were yet to begin; the first event was scheduled for September 29.Click here to view.We also found a Facebook post by Yarraji's coach, James Hillier, shared on September 26. The post mentioned how Yarraji was still on her way to Hangzhou for the Asian Games.The caption read, \"Let the games begin \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 En route to Hangzhou for the Asian Games. Good luck to all of Team India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 and to Team Hillier @amlan_borgohain & @jyothi_yarraji_.\"",

What a Security !\"View such posts here, here and here.The same clip has also been shared on WhatsApp with the exact same caption.Fact CheckBOOM ran a few keyframes from the viral video through a reverse image search on Google, and found that the footage has been shared on social media with multiple captions over the past nine months.An Instagram account that posts visuals of aircraft posted the same clip on September 4, 2023, with the caption, \"Real or Fake.\"Going through the comments, we found many users stating that the aircraft seen in the viral footage did not match the specifications of the Air Force One's Boeing 747-200B models. The users found that the aircraft in the viral footage had a winglet - vertical extensions at the far ends of the wings - which the original Air Force One models do not have.We compared the aircraft in the viral video with images of the Air Force One on Boeing's website, and found that the former did have additional winglets, which were not seen on the official image by Boeing.The Instagram post also contained responses that suggested that the footage was not real, and was taken from a combat flight simulator called Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) World.Looking through the reverse image searches of the keyframes, we also found the video being shared on TikTok by user @iceman_fox1 on January 25, 2023, with the caption, \"POV: President Trump returning to the White House shortly after winning the 2024 election.\"The user also added hashtags like #dcs, #dcsworld, #videogame, indicating that the footage was taken from the video game DCS World.The account bio further mentions that the user posts \"Realistic DCS videos\", thus confirming that the viral footage was not real, but from DCS World.Additional reporting by Sujith A.",

The Kathmandu Post reported that at least 10 Nepali students were killed when Hamas militants entered into Israel and fired rounds of rockets and grenades at their residence. The report further added that four other Nepalis were injured in the attacks and one Nepali student, Bipin Joshi, from Kanchanpur, is still missing.The names mentioned in the article match with the names in the viral photo.Click here to viewWe also found an official press release dated October 15, 2023, by the Nepal's embassy in Israel confirms the name of five deceased students whose names match with the names in the viral photo.Additionally, the addresses for the citizens mentioned in the viral photo are all based in Nepal. We also reached out Nepal Fact Check who confirmed that the 17 locations mentioned in the list are all in Nepal.India's Ministry of External Affairs has also stated as on October 12, 2023, that there was no information regarding Indian causalities in Israel during the recent Hamas attack.

BOOM found that the claims are false and the image has been created using genrative-AI.The Israel-Hamas conflict, which began on October 7 has killed at least 3,195 children, about 40% of the total death toll of 7,703 people. The number of children reported dead has surpassed the annual number of child deaths in any other world conflict since 2019, according to Save the Children. The conflict, that has now entered its fourth week, began after Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel from Gaza, resulting in retaliatory air strikes and a ground invasion by Israel.The image shows a father carrying three children on his shoulders, one infant in his arms, and another child holding his hand with the backdrop of a city devastated by bombings. A caption on X (formerly Twitter) reads, \"Being a father in Gaza is like this. \ud83d\udc94\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8\"Click here to view the image and here for an archive.The post is also circulating on Facebook with similar captions.Click here to view the post.FACT-CHECKBOOM found that the image has been made using generative-AI and is not from the Israel-Hamas conflict.We noticed a few extra limbs in the image, a common irregularity found in AI-generated images.We ran the image through AI image detector tools AIOrNot.com and Hive Moderator, both of which suggested that the image was likely generated by AI.BOOM also reached out to Professor Hany Farid at the University of California, Berkeley, who specialises in digital forensics, misinformation, and AI. Speaking about the image, Prof Farid said, \"This image is almost certainly AI-generated. In addition to our models classifying it as AI, there are telltale signs in the image like the misshapen arm of the adult.\"",

So far, the conflict has claimed more than 1,400 lives in Israel, and more than 4,137 Palestinians in Gaza.A user shared the video - which had the text \"Saudi Prince Slams Israel\" on Instagram on October 16, 2023, with the caption, \"#freepalestine\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f.\" (Click here to view an archive)In the video, Al Saud can be heard saying, \"From the time of the Balfour Declaration, they have forcibly evicted the inhabitants of Palestine after the 1948 war as attested to by Israeli historians. They burned the villages of the Palestinians to the ground.\"We also found the same video going viral on Facebook, which can be viewed here and here.Fact CheckBOOM noticed that the video had the text \"IISS\" written in the background, along with \"IISS Manama Dialogue\" written on the podium from where Al Saud was speaking.Taking cue from this, we did a keyword search with \"saudi prince iiss manama dialogue speech\", which led us to a YouTube video uploaded by the channel The International Institute for Strategic Studies on December 6, 2020.The video was a recording of the final day of the IISS Manama Dialogue, an annual event held by The International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain's capital Manama, in 2020.At the 2:45 mark into the YouTube video we found the portion of the recording which was shared in Instagram, where Al Saud can be heard making the exact same statement about Israel.Al Saud's speech has also been covered by various news outlets, including the Financial Times, which added the headline, \"Senior Saudi royal launches tirade against Israel.\"The video is therefore old, and is being misleading revived in the wake of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.",

A few Migrants were doing what they do best ... Taharrush (roughly translates to mass molestation of women)... Unfortunately for these migrants, these 3 women were all serving French para-military.\"Click here, here and here to view some of these posts.The video was also shared on Facebook with the same claim, which can be viewed here.Fact CheckGoing through the comments, BOOM noticed that many users were questioning whether the fight seen in the video was real or choreographed.Doing a frame-by-frame analysis, we found one of the men in the video wearing a hoodie with a logo that says CUC.Taking cue from this, we did a keyword search with \"CUC fight\", which led us to several Facebook videos by a group of France-based stunt people called Campus Univers Cascade showing fighting tutorials.One of the video showed a choreographed street fight between female MMA fighters against a few men (view here).We combed through CUC's Instagram page, and found the viral video being shared on their page on November 2, 2023. The video was shared with hashtags like #stuntteam #stuntlife and #choreography# which suggested that the fight was staged, and not real.BOOM reached out to Lucas Dollfus, the founder of CUC, who confirmed to us that the video was in fact staged, and did not show a real life scenario.Speaking to BOOM over Instagram, Dollfus said, \"This is indeed a video made with stuntmen from our school: Campus Univers Cascades. It's a staged video and of course it's fake, everything is choreographed and prepared in advance. The aim of the work is to be realistic... it seems to have worked too well.\"\"We are sorry that this is being misused and shared for the wrong cause,\" he added, after being informed of the Islamophobic claims that were being shared with the video.",

According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, nearly 9,700 people have been killed, mostly women and children.Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan posted on X on November 3, 2023, condemning the killing of children in Gaza and calling on world leaders to \"unite and put an end to this senseless killing\". Pakistan cricketer Muhammad Rizwan had dedicated his team's win in the ODI World Cup match against Sri Lanka to the people of Gaza on October 11, 2023.

Ronaldo reciprocates with a hug and gifts her an Al Nassr club jersey bearing the inscription 'Ronaldo 7'.The video is being shared with the caption, \"Iran sentences Cristiano Ronaldo to 99 lashes for touching a single woman F\u00e1tima Hamami (a painter with 85% body paralysis) who gave him a painting.

However, a judge could potentially pardon the sentence if the actions are deemed non-punishable or if those involved express remorse.\"The story was updated later.Fact CheckBOOM did a related keyword search and found that Iranian Embassy in Spain denied the reports of Ronaldo facing '99 lashes' for touching a woman in Iran.The embassy, from its verified X (formerly known as Twitter) handle, refuted the claim in the post, \"We strongly deny the issuance of any court ruling against any international athlete in Iran. It is a matter of concern that the publication of such unfounded news could overshadow crimes against humanity and war crimes against the oppressed Palestinian nation.\"The clarification further adds, \"It should be noted that Cristiano Ronaldo traveled to Iran on September 18 and 19 to play in an official soccer match and was very well received by the people and the authorities. His sincere and humane meeting with Fatemeh Hamami was also praised and admired by both the people and the country's sports authorities.\"Desmentimos rotundamente la emisi\u00f3n de cualquier fallo judicial contra cualquier deportista internacional en Ir\u00e1n.

        "doc": "A viral message on the internet claims that 167 Muslim children are born daily in government hospitals in Kerala, purportedly outnumbering those of other religions. The message further adds that Muslim birth rate far outnumber those of other religions across the country.Additionally, the claim says, \"To implement Talibani Sharia law and make India a Muslim state, the action is going on in full speed.\"BOOM found these claims to be false. The Kerala government does not furnish religion-specific information for institutions such as government or private hospitals. Similarly, the Union government does not provide data on births categorised by religion at the national level.Previously, BOOM had verified a similar claim which stated that Delhi accounted for 167 births of Muslim children in government hospitals daily, vastly outnumbering newborns of other religious communities. We found that the viral posts falsely stated that Muslim newborns outnumbered those of other religions in government hospitals in Delhi and across the country.Fact-checkBOOM analysed the Kerala government's Annual Vital Statistics Report 2021 (latest available), published by the Department of Economics and Statistics and further analysed official data from the Vital Statistics of India reports based on the Civil Registration System 2020, the latest available, for the pan-India claim. We found the both claims to be incorrect.Government of KeralaClaim 1: \"The record of child birth in a day in government hospital in Kerala is: Hindu (37), Christian (12), Sikh (17), Muslim (167).\"While the government of Kerala keeps an overall record of data on births based on religion, data specifically related to religion-wise break-up of births in institutions such as government and private hospitals is not available. Apart from the overall religion-based break-up on total births, the only other information broken down on religious lines is the age of the mother at the time of giving birth, the birth order of the children and whether it took place in an urban or rural setting.The latest release of this data pertains to 2021, which was published by the Kerala government in May, 2023.In 2021, Kerala recorded 4,19,767 births. This means that the state saw around 1,150 births per day. These figures include the rural and the urban population.Of these, newborns who were born into a Hindu family accounted for the most number of births (1,81,396 or 43.2% births were Hindu). This was followed by Muslims (1,69,296) accounting for 40.3% of the births and Christians (14.2%), among other religions.This means that around 497 newborns are born into Hindu families per day whereas approximately 464 are born into Muslim families.Further, the government also provides data related to institutional (government and private hospitals) births in Kerala. More than 4.14 lakh births took place in hospitals across Kerala in 2021. Of these, 32.1% of the births were in government hospitals whereas 68% were in private or non-government hospitals.There is no religion-wise break down on the institutional status of births as the claim states.Union GovernmentClaim 2: \"All India highest record of child birth in a day: Hindu (3,337), Christian (1,222), Sikh (1,117), Muslim (58,167).\"This claim is false because the Union government does not provide national data related to births by religion.Note: The data in the latest CRS report pertains to the year 2020. The report was released in 2022.Sharp decline in fertility rate among Muslims over the last two decadesMuslims have the highest fertility rate (average number of children born to a woman in her lifetime) as compared to the other religious groups in the country. However, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), the fertility rate of the Muslim community has seen the most significant decrease in comparison to other religious communities.Every religious group in India has seen its fertility fall. The fertility rate among Hindus has dropped from 3.3 children per woman in 1992-93 to 1.94 in the latest NFHS-5 survey. Among Muslims, it has dropped from 4.4 children per woman in 1992-93 to 2.3 in 2019-21.Data indicates a 46.5% decline in fertility rates among Muslims since 1992-93 and a 41.2% decrease among Hindus.Using 2011 Census data, a study by Ghosh (2018) found that regions with high fertility levels were marked by high fertility across various groups, regardless of socio-religious affiliation or women's educational attainment. The same pattern was observed in regions with low fertility rates.Similarly, according to a report from the PEW Research Center, \"people's religion alone does not determine how many children they will have.\"Population growth is influenced not just by the number of children women bear but also by the distribution of women in their childbearing years. Younger populations, with more women entering their prime childbearing age, typically experience faster growth compared to older populations. Moreover, factors such as geographical location within India, historical context, and cultural norms, contribute to individuals' decisions regarding family-related matters, the report stated.",

In the original video, the line 'Ishwar Allah Tero Naam' from the bhajan 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' was played.AdvertisementSeveral heads of foreign governments, who were in New Delhi to be part of the G20 summit on September 9-10, paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi on September 10 at New Delhi's memorial complex Rajghat.

The line in the hymn 'Ishwar Allah Tero Naam, Sabko Sanmati De Bhagwan' can be heard at 1:22:04 timestamp in the video.On the other hand, a keyword search for 'Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram LoFi' led us to the same song that has been overlaid to the visuals of the world leaders visiting Rajghat.The segment of the song, which has been used in the viral clip, can be heard from 1:20 minutes to 2:47 minutes time mark.Full ViewThe Bhajan - Raghupati Raghav Raja RamAccording to the Ministry of Culture, Government of India website, Indian Culture, \"Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram and Vaishnav Jan To were two favourite hymns of Mahatma Gandhi, who hailed from the Porbandar district in Gujarat. These bhajans eventually became the chants of the Satyagraha movement.\"It further adds, \"Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram is based on the 17th hymn of Ramdas. There were numerous versions of the poem by the 20th century. Gandhiji preferred the tune by Pandit Vishnu Digambar Pulaskar. Mahatma Gandhi modified the third line of the hymn when he adopted it to \"Ishwar Allah Tere Naam; Sabko Sanmati De Bhagwan\" to include Muslims as well.\"",

Following this social media has been flooded with unverified imagery being linked to the ongoing conflict.Several X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook users then shared the viral video, with the caption, \"Israeli Defense forces are now evacuating Air Bases near Gaza as thousands of terrorists flood into Israel. This situation is just escalating.\"View the posts on X here, here and here.View the posts on Facebook here, here and here.Fact CheckBOOM ran a keyword search with \"Israel evacuate fighter jets Gaza\", but was unable to find any recent credible report on the ongoing conflict that mentioned any such evacuation efforts.We then ran a reverse image search with keyframes from the video, and found a few posts on X, from September 15, 2023, that contained the same video.The video was being shared (here, here and here) on the microblogging platform with the caption, \"Two F-16 fighter jets transported by ground transport were spotted in southern Israel.\"Two F-16 fighter jets transported by ground transport were spotted in southern Israel pic.twitter.com/JcKpPYqSUk \u2014 Sprinter (@Sprinter99800) September 14, 2023Taking cue from this, we ran a few keyword searches, but were unable to find any news report from September mentioning the transportation of the fighter jets.The video also showed directional signs showing names of the towns \"Ar'ara BaNegev and Arad\", both located in the Southern District of Israel, indicating that the captions above have correctly identified the location of the footage as Southern Israel.BOOM was unable to independently verify when the video was shot, and in what context. However, it predates the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas by over three weeks, and is thus unrelated to it.",

The video features visuals of Schwab from the 54th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos, held on January 16, 2024.In the 19-second video, the speaker appears to be at a World Economic Forum event. The clip shows the speaker shouting profanities and then shows Schwab exiting the stage. The man in the video says, \"I appreciate the World Economic Forum providing me the opportunity to be on this stage and say, 'f**** you Klaus Schwab and f*** your new world order. We the people were born free; we will stay free and you and all of your global friends including everyone in this room can f*** yourself'.\"The video is being shared on X with a caption, \"BREAKING: World Economic Forum speaker tells Klaus Schwab to \"go f**** himself and participants with their new world order\".\"(Note, the video contains expletives.

He alleged that it was an attempt to \"demonetise\" his post.Elon Musk posted on October 29, 2023, that X posts featuring community notes will no longer be eligible for advertisement revenue sharing. The Community Note is a feature on X that allows users to provide context to misleading posts on the platform.Making a slight change to creator monetization:Any posts that are corrected by @CommunityNotes become ineligible for revenue share.The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 29, 2023Visuals of Klaus Schwab and Swiss President Viola Amherd exiting the stage are from a video streamed live on the World Economic Forum's official YouTube channel on January 16, 2024 and can be seen from the 27 minutes and 9 seconds mark.",

The young man in the hospital lost his leg during an Israeli raid at a refugee camp in the West Bank in July 2023 whereas the man in the other clip is Gaza blogger Saleh Aljafarawi.The Gaza strip which is controlled by Islamic militant group Hamas has been under constant bombardment by Israeli airstrikes after the attack by the militant group on October 7, 2023, which killed 1400 Israelis and had taken 200 hostages. According to Gaza's Ministry of Health 7,028 Palestinians, including 2,913 minors have been killed so far in these airstrikes.In the 24 seconds video, which has a split comparison, on one frame a Gaza blogger talking about the Israeli airstrikes, and in the second frame an injured person can be seen hospitalised. The caption of the video claims that it shows the same person hospitalised just a day before and the very next day running around and reporting on the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.'Pallywood' is an unfounded right-wing conspiracy where Palestinian civilians are falsely accused of staging their injuries or deaths. The term is a play on the words Hollywood and Palestine. Pro-Israel accounts also use the terms 'crisis actors' to peddle the bogus conspiracy. BOOM has previously debunked several such pieces of misinformation.The video was tweeted by Hananya Naftali (@HananyaNaftali), Israeli influencer and former social media adviser for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who posted the video on X (formerly known as Twitter) with the caption, \"Palestinian blogger \"miraculously\" healed in one day from \"Israeli bombing\". Yesterday, he was \"hospitalized,\" today, he is walking and walking like nothing happened, I don't watch Netflix because Pallywood propaganda is the actual comedy.\"Click here to viewThe same false claim was also tweeted by the Israel's official X handle with the hospital video claiming that both are the same individuals. The post has now been deleted.Click here to view an archiveSeveral other verified X accounts including Mr Sinha (@MrSinha_) posted the same false claim. BOOM has previously debunked misinformation posted by this Indian handle.Click here to viewFACT-CHECKBOOM found that the individuals in both these videos, one of a boy in the hospital, and another of a man on ground in Gaza are different. The first video from a hospital is of a 16 year old boy - Mohammed Zendiq who lost his leg during an Israeli raid at the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank on July 24, 2023. Whereas the man seen in the second video giving commentary on ground about the Israeli airstrikes is Saleh Aljafarawi, a blogger who has been documenting the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Taking hint from several posts identifying the man in the second video as Palestinian blogger Aljafarawi, we found the original video which was posted by him on his Instagram handle on October 26, 2023. The same building as in the viral video can be seen here.Click here to viewSeveral other videos of him on the ground documenting the impact of the airstrikes have also gone viral on X which are posted on his Instagram handleClick here to viewAdditionally, on breaking the hospital video into keyframes and running a reverse image search, we found that the original video was posted on Tik Tok around two months ago by the handle (@hamodahmdan1). This pre-dates the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas which began after the October 7, 2023.Click here to viewWe can see other videos of Zendiq posted on Tik Tok, one uploaded last month where he can be seen moving his amputated leg.The viral hospital video had been posted on August 18, 2023, with the hashtag \"#Nour_Shams_Camp_\". On searching for this camp we found that it is located in the occupied West Bank. This individual is not from Gaza or the same Palestinian blogger in Gaza as being claimed on social media.We found news reports on the boy in the viral hospital video who is 16 years old and his name is Mohammed Zendiq. Zendiq is reported to have lost his leg during an Israeli raid at the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank on July 24, 2023.We also found a news report dated August 25, 2023 by International Solidarity Movement which has a photo of Zendiq wounded and admitted to the hospital during that time.The report states that at the time of the Israeli raid, he was standing in the street when he suddenly felt an explosion. Zendiq was then rushed to an Israeli hospital where his right leg was amputated just above the knee and he was released on August 21, 2023.",

He had also briefly carried a suitcase on his head as he walked along with them.Section 420 in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) deals with cheating. The number 420 is used negatively in the Indian connotation often used to describe someone as a cheat.

The original badge that was tied by the porter on Rahul Gandhi's arm actually has the number '756'.We checked the photos posted by Gandhi on his official Instagram handle and found that the number on the badge is '756'. Gandhi posted several photos of his interaction with railway porters on September 21, 2023 on Instagram.On zooming on the badge we can clearly see the number '756' written on it.A comparison of both the images can be seen belowAdditionally, in an interview to the YouTube channel The Mithila, the porter who had tied the badge on Gandhi's hand also dismissed the claim that the badge no is '420' stating that it is '756'.

The article was titled 'Video: 2 girls drugged, kidnapped inside elevator Egypt' and carried visuals similar to the viral video.Taking a cue from the headline, we ran another keyword search on Google and found several news reports about the incident. According to Al Arabiya, the incident took place on December 13 in Nasr City and the matter came to light after the girls' mother filed a complaint against the father at the local police station. The father, an accountant, had separated from the girls' mother and until 2022, the girls were living with their father.Another report by Al-Masry Al-Youm published on December 21 reported that while the men successfully kidnapped one of the sisters, they left the other one behind after her constant resistance. The report also carried a statement by the Interior Ministry which states that the father left the country with one of the girls on the day of the incident. An investigation into the matter revealed that the father had hired two people-- one to carry out the kidnapping with him and the other to drive the car. According to the Interior Ministry, both these men have been arrested.",

        "doc": "Several official Israel X (formerly Twitter) handles and other pro-Israel accounts shared a CCTV footage and an unrelated video to falsely claim that Palestinian youth Mohammed Nazzal had not suffered any injures after being released from Israeli prison. Nazzal (18) was recently released from an Israel prison among several other Palestinian prisoners as part of a truce agreement between Israel and Hamas last week.BOOM found that the claims are false and Nazzal sustained fractures in both of his hands. The same was also independently verified by Arabic fact-checking website Misbar and the BBC. We also found that an unrelated video of another Palestinian youth Mohammed Shattara was being shared falsely as Nazzal.As soon as the week-long truce between Israel and Islamist militant group Hamas ended, the former resumed its attack on Palestine where Hamas is based. The renewed bombardment has killed over 700 Palestinians taking the total number of Palestininandeaths since October 7, 2023 to over 15,000. In Israel the official death toll stands at about 1,200.Israel government's official X handle tweeted CCTV footage of Nazzal leaving the Israeli prison with the caption, \"CCTV footage shows Mohamed Nazal leaving prison and boarding the bus with two perfectly working arms.\" This was accompanied by a screenshot of a tweet claiming Nazal was tortured while in prison.Click here to view, and here for an archiveBOOM has previously fact-checked misinformation posted by Israel's official handle about the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine.Another verified X handle @OliLondonTV posted a video of a young Palestinian boy hugging people and using his arms freely comparing it with a photo of Nazzal's fractured hands in a sling.The caption read, \"Palestinian man, Mohammed Nazal, who was serving a jail sentence in Israel for terror-related offenses before being exchanged for Israeli hostages, claimed both his arms were broken by Israeli police officers while in jail. After being released, he is seen embracing relatives with both of his arms intact and perfectly normal. However, shortly after greeting his relatives his arms were placed in casts while he was paraded in several staged Hamas propaganda videos where he claimed his arms had been broken prior to his release from prison.\"Click here to view, and here for an archiveRight-wing Indian columnist Abhijit Iyer-Mitra also posted the same video making the same false claim and targeting Alt News co-founder and fact-checker Mohammed Zubair. BOOM has previously debunked misinformation posted by Mitra.Click here to view, and here for an archiveFACT-CHECKBOOM found that the claims that the Palestinian youngster Mohammed Nazzal did not have any injures after being released from the Israeli prison is false and that he sustained injuries on both his hand.We were able to establish that Nazzal did indeed sustain injuries on both his hands, based on independent reports from different media outlets. We also found that the second video showing a young Palestinian boy hugging his relatives after being released from Israeli prison is not Nazzal but Mohammed Shattara.Arabic fact-checking website Misbar debunked the false claim that was tweeted by Israel's official handle and accessed his medical records which confirmed that post his release from the Israeli prison, medical examinations showed fractures in his fingers, particularly in the index and thumb on both hands.Picture credit: MisbarMisbar also included the the X-ray copies they received from Nazzal's family that showed the extent of the fractures in his fingers.Picture credit: MisbarNazzal (18) was arrested in August and held till recently, without any official charges in an Israeli prison. He was released along with other Palestinians held prisoners by the Israel government, as part of the week long truce deal between Hamas and Israel. After his release, Nazzal alleged that he had been tortured in prison.His interview can be seen below where he narrates how his fingers were broken while in prison.Below is a tweet with another interview of his to a media outlet, with English subtitles.5- UPDATE: Mohammed Nazal's medial record was just released: showing broken & fractured fingers, contusions in his arms & bruises on his back.The report recommends \"surgical fixation\" to correct the fingers that were broken & left for days without treatment. pic.twitter.com/VH6eKLvEfs \u2014 Muhammad Shehada (@muhammadshehad2) November 29, 2023BBC in its report, verified Nazzal's medical reports by two independent doctors in the UK, who confirmed that x-rays taken from Palestinian doctors in Ramallah showed fractures on both of Mohammed's hands.Unrelated video of Palestinian youth Mohammed Shattara falsely shared as Mohammed NazzalWe also found that the video being shared as Nazzal of a Palestinian youth hugging his relatives after his release from the prison is Mohammed Shattara.We found several posts reporting about Shattara, including by Muhammad Shehada, a writer and civil society activist from the Gaza Strip.In the below tweet thread from November 29, 2023, we can see Shattara's face clearly visible. It bears no resemblance to Nazzal, and establishes that he's a different person.The caption in Arabic translates to, \"Muhammed Shattara, who is from Jerusalem was transferred to a hospital to receive treatment as a result of his skin rash, infections, and swelling in his fingers, due to poor conditions and torture inside Israeli prison after he was released.\"\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0634\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629\u060c \u064a\u0644\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0628\u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0649 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0631\u0641\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0632\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u062d\u062c\u0629 \"\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629\". https://t.co/pVhLZCWpIg pic.twitter.com/Sp3pkxCFmf \u2014 \u0642.\u0636 \ud80c\udc86 (@jalestinian) November 28, 2023Additionally Shattara is reported to hail from Jerusalem, whereas Nazzal is from Jennin.",

        "doc": "Several deepfake videos were found being promoted on Facebook ads, which falsely portrayed ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund Managing Director Nimesh Shah promising stock recommendations for 2024.BOOM found strong evidence suggesting that these videos were fabricated using a voice cloning software. Furthermore, ICICI Prudential AMC spokesperson confirmed to us that no such stock recommendation promises were made by Shah, as seen in the Facebook videos, and that they were deceptively edited from an interview he gave to the Outlook Magazine.In the deepfake video, which has been found being promoted on Meta's ad library on January 20, 2024, Shah is purportedly shown saying, \"Stock trading is a business that can make you rich overnight. I recommended six stocks in 2023. These stocks made huge profits today. I will still recommend several of my favourite stocks for free in 2024.\"When BOOM started looking into this matter, as many as 9 such ads were found running with the fraudulent video, which contained a broken Facebook link, and a caption that promised \"the strongest Indian stocks in 2024!\".BOOM found this video being shared by promoted posts that promised \"the strongest Indian stocks in 2024\". We searched on Facebook's ad library with relevant keywords and found several others of similar nature were running during our search.Fact CheckBOOM closely viewed the video being promoted on Facebook ads, and found several indications of manipulation. The video had jump cuts, and the speech was unnatural, with sentences ending and beginning abruptly.Furthermore, the voice and the lip movement were noticeably out of sync, with the lips continuing to move even when the speech appears to stop. These serve as telltale signs of deepfake manipulation, through an AI voice cloning software.We also observed the logo of personal finance magazine Outlook Money watermarked on the top left corner of the video. Taking cue from this, we did a keyword search on YouTube, which led us to several videos being published by Outlook Magazine on their interaction with Shah.We went through these videos, where Shah was found promoting ICICI Prudential AMC, and discussing the Indian economy. In one of the videos, Shah is found giving a financial advice.None of the videos showed him promoting certain stocks, or promising to provide specific stock recommendations, as seen in the promoted ad on Facebook.Furthermore, BOOM also downloaded the video of Shah from Facebook ad library, and ran it through an AI voice cloning detector called 'AI Speech Classifier' by popular voice cloning software Eleven Labs, which indicates if their voice cloning software had been used to create synthetic media.The tool indicated that the video had 98% likelihood of Eleven Labs voice cloning tool being used to create the video that had been promoted on Facebook ads.BOOM also reached out to ICICI Prudential AMC, and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the video is fraudulent.The company also put out a statement adding, \"Certain unauthorised and maliciously manipulated videos have been disseminated across various online platforms, providing stock recommendations, using the name of our senior executive and the brand name and logo of our company.\"Photography, Editing Page Becomes 'Stock Analyst'We also looked into the advertiser of the deepfake video - an obscure page titled \"Stock Analyst\", having a little over 300 likes and followers, respectively.The page username was found to be 'vivekanilphotography', and the page, created on January 12, 2015, had names like 'VA editz', 'VA editz and clicks', 'Vivek Anil Photography', and 'IShoots Photography', before changing the name to 'Stock Analyst' on December 26, 2023.This indicates that the page has been repurposed from one that provided photography and editing services to one that purports to provide stock analysis.BOOM reached out to Meta for a comment, and the article will be updated with the responses if and when we receive one.We also reached out the the phone number provided in the Bio of the Facebook page, but was informed by the telecom service provided that 'incoming service was not active' on this number.BOOM had previously reported on scam videos made using voice cloning technology being promoted on Facebook, impersonating industrialists, influencers and celebrities to promote fraudulent investment funds.",

Rescue operations have begun and the death toll of the earthquake has reached 48. Countries including Russia and South Korea have issued tsunami warnings as well.The viral video shows a man standing near the coast with his arms spread wide, a woman alongside him, and a man shooting the tsunami using a selfie stick. A few second later, they are all washed away by the waves. A caption on X reads, Don't ever do this during #tsunami. Stay home stay safe. #earthquake #JapanEarthquake #earthquake #Japan\"Click here to view the post and here for an archive.The post is being shared on Facebook with the caption, \"WTF WAS HE THINKING!?! #japan #earthquake #tsunami\"Click here to view the post.FACT CHECKBOOM found that the video shows a tidal bore that occurred in Indonesia in December 2021 and is unrelated to the recent Japan earthquake.We ran a reverse image search of some key frames from the viral video on Yandex and found a YouTube video shared on January 17, 2022 that carried visuals similar to the viral video. The video was titled 'Tsunami in the times of Tik Tok, a madness to record the best moment' and showed three clips in the same frame: from the point of view of each person in the viral video including the woman and the man with the selfie stick. See here.In this video, the clip shown in the third frame is a match to the viral video.We ran a reverse image search of these visuals again on Google and found an Indonesian news report published on December 9, 2021 that carried a similar visual of the woman seen in the viral clip.A report by Detik News published on December 9, 2021, mentioned how the video was taken during a Bono wave, also known as a tidal bore, in Riau. The report also quoted an official who explained how tidal bores were a common tourist attraction near the Kampar River in Riau, where the video was shot.Taking a clue from this, we ran a search for the video on YouTube using Ombak Bono, the Indonesian word for tidal bores, and found a video similar to the viral video shared on December 7, 2021. This video was taken from the point of the view of the man in the red t-shirt carrying a selfie stick. At 3:49, the woman and the man near the tree are also visible in the frame.BOOM could not independently verify the exact date the video was taken, but it is at least as old as early December 2021 and is unrelated to the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",

BOOM found that the video has been clipped to make the false claim, the original video shows Gandhi saying 50+15+8=73.  Rahul Gandhi is currently spearheading the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, the second leg of his original Bharat Jodo Yatra, where he is travelling from Manipur to Mumbai, covering 14 states across a distance of a6,200 kilometers.  The viral video shows Gandhi saying, \"How much is it? 50+15. It's 73.\" The video was shared on X with the caption, \"50+15 = 73 \ud83d\ude0e\"              Click here to view the post and here for an archive.  The video is also being shared on Facebook with the caption, \"According to Rahul Gandhi, 50+15=73 \ud83d\ude02\"              Click here to view the post.      FACT CHECK  BOOM found that the video has been cropped and shared with the false claim. The original video shows Gandhi speaking about the distribution of OBC, Dalits, and Adivasi individuals in the country, saying each of them form about 50%, 15%, and 8% of the population respectively. He then says that all three of these combines represent 73% of the population.  We went through the Indian National Congress' official YouTube channel and looked for any recent public address by Rahul Gandhi. A livestream from February 8, 2024 where Gandhi is addressing a crowd in Chhattisgarh had visuals similar to the viral video. The video was titled \"LIVE | Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra | Jharsuguda to Raigarh | Chhattisgarh | Rahul Gandhi\"  In this speech, Gandhi is heard narrating how a journalist asked him about the effectiveness of implementing a caste census, an initiative that has been one of the main highlights of Gandhi's Yatra. When asked whether a caste census would create further divide, Gandhi asked the journalist if they knew how many OBCs, Adivasis, and Dalits owned newspapers in the country. Continuing this, he is heard saying from the 19:50 mark, \"It is estimated that about 50-55% (of people in the country) are from backward castes. 15% are Dalits. 8% are Adivasis. How much is it (total)? How much is 50+15+8? 73.\"  He then talks about how this population of 73% is not represented in the media or the government.  The part where he adds 8 to 50+15 has been clipped from the viral video to claim that Gandhi made a calculation mistake.  Watch the full video here:",
